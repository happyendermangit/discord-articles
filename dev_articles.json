To use Premium Apps and monetize your application using App Subscriptions, you’ll need to meet and maintain a series of requirements and <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000656491\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">policies</a>. This article is a broad overview of what this process looks like.</p>\n<p>Upgrading an app to premium consists of 3 main phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#h_01HB8WP0GADB3NZ78DM0CVE9N4\">Onboarding</a> - A series of automated checks in the <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/developers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Developer Portal</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#h_01HB8WP0GBE0P7X6P16ZVVRHBW\">Integration</a> - Developers add a premium SKU to which a user can subscribe</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"#h_01HB8WP0GB6ZFV8TQ18SZ77K11\">Payout</a> - After an app makes its first $100 and subsequent $25 increments on a monthly basis</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to complete these phases, app owners, teams, and apps will all need to meet many requirements and complete a series of steps.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HB8WP0GADB3NZ78DM0CVE9N4\">Step 1 - Onboarding Requirements</h2>\n<p>The onboarding flow consists of checks for the following requirements:</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8WP0GAXC66J85688WRKPXE\">App Requirements</h3>\n<p>A Premium App must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040720412-Bot-Verification-and-Data-Allowlisting\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">verified</a>\n</li>\n<li>Belong to a Developer Team</li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands#application-commands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">application commands</a>, or have been approved for the <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#message-content-intent\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Message Content privileged intent</a>\n</li>\n<li>Have a link to your Terms of Service</li>\n<li>Have a link to your Privacy Policy</li>\n<li>Not contain any harmful or bad language in the name, description, commands, or role connection metadata.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8WP0GB6W76S5HEWSKB58RY\">Developer Team Owner Requirements</h3>\n<p>Developer team owner must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be over 18 years old</li>\n<li>Have a verified email and 2FA set up</li>\n<li>Must be located in the US, UK, or EU</li>\n<li>Agree to the <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monetization Terms</a> and <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17442400631959\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Premium Apps Policy</a>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8WP0GBMT4E142096S9HYYS\">Developer Team Member Requirements</h3>\n<p>All developer team members must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have a verified email and 2FA set up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on the Onboarding process visit the <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17708927296663\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Premium App Onboarding</a> article.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HB8WP0GBE0P7X6P16ZVVRHBW\">Step 2 - SKUs and Monetization</h2>\n<p>Once an app has successfully been onboarded, SKUs can be added to the app within the developer portal. Initially, there will be 2 types of SKUs you can add to your apps: User and Guild Subscriptions. Currently, an app can only publish 1 SKU at a time but can create as many unpublished SKUs as desired.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8WP0GB5883T28K8SCJB02E\">Types of SKUs</h3>\n<p><strong>User Subs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows a user to purchase access to your app’s premium features across all servers they are in with the app</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Guild Subs</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows a server owner to purchase access to your app’s premium features that can be offered to all members on that server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more information on setting up SKUs and monetizing your app, visit the <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17298449675927\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Premium Apps SKU Setup</a> article.</p>\n<p>Once an app has SKUs added within the Developer Portal, they can be accessed through the API and devs can code the subscription functionality into their app.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8WP0GBZGA9R5KP8QTJ2GWH\">Monetization</h3>\n<p>Once an app has set up a SKU and they have been integrated into the app's code, there are 4 ways users will be able to subscribe:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Server admins can use the Integrations settings menu\n<ul>\n<li>Go to Server Settings → Integrations → [App Name] → scroll to the bottom of the page, and see upgrade buttons</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Attempting to run a premium command will offer the Upgrade button in the response</li>\n<li>Bot profiles will offer the Upgrade button</li>\n<li>App Directory profiles will offer a Premium tab containing subscription details and an Upgrade option.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17822040299415\" alt=\"Untitled (1).png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB97XFN09QYQVV0VRPQGV39K\">Can I keep using my existing payment system?</h3>\n<p>Yes. You can continue using existing payment systems, such as Patreon or Stripe integrations on external websites. We'll provide an update to our policies soon to clarify how we’ll treat the promotion of third-party payment options on Discord as we continue to expand our native monetization features. Discord is committed to ensuring great, safe, and secure premium experience for all of our users and developers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HB8WP0GB6ZFV8TQ18SZ77K11\">Step 3 - Payout</h2>\n<p>Once an app has made its first $100 it will become eligible for payout. A review will be conducted and if everything looks good, your team will begin to receive payouts.</p>\n<p>For more information please visit the <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17299902720919\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Premium Apps Payouts</a> article.</p>\n<p>Once you have a verified app, owned by a team, that supports slash commands or has the message content privileged intent, you can check out the <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17297949965079\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Do I Monetize My App?</a> article for next steps!</p>\n<p>After reviewing this and other linked articles, if you have any questions about Premium Apps and App Subscriptions, please <a href=\"https://dis.gd/developer-support/premium-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reach out to our Developer Support team</a>!</p>"

Make sure to account for this temporary discriminator when updating your code.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H26BDRT8ASH1YVKG6HMGZ1J2\">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>\n<h3>Why isn’t Discord making this change for apps?</h3>\n<p>Although bots are users under the hood, they still interact differently with Discord. Our username changes are all about making it easier to find and add your friends on Discord. Bots don’t have friends—they get a little lonely sometimes—so we’re keeping them as-is.</p>\n<p>In the future, we may consider changing how apps are represented on Discord to make them more distinct from normal users so that you can show off the awesome things you build in a way that makes them feel distinct.</p>\n<h3>Will users be able to claim my app’s name?</h3>\n<p>First and foremost, we want users to be able to express themselves how they want on Discord. However, there will be some names that are blocked or reserved to combat potential abuse and impersonation. We want to ensure that users aren’t harmed by bad actors that may try to impersonate known and trusted entities on Discord.</p>\n<p>Impersonation is against our terms of service and can be reported to our Trust and Safety team. We also have processes through which to act on Trademark disputes or DMCA takedowns. Those are all available through our online support form: <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\">https://dis.gd/contact</a></p>\n<h3>Will apps be able to update their names?</h3>\n<p>Consider App names, business as usual! If yours is not verified, you can change its name within the app’s Developer Portal page. If your app is verified, you may <a href=\"https://dis.gd/developer-support\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">submit a request to Developer Support</a> and that request will be reviewed by a Support Agent.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">As always, if you have any further questions please </span><a style=\"background-color: #282929; font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\" href=\"https://dis.gd/developer-support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-darkreader-inline-bgcolor=\"\">contact Developer Support</a><span style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 15px;\">.</span></p>"

        "body": "<h2>\n<strong>Intro to the intro</strong> (¬‿¬ )</h2>\n<p>So you're a dope Discord dev and you’ve built a really cool app that tons of people in your favorite communities use to help make their servers great. Your friend gets an invite to a seemingly cool server your peeps can’t stop raving about, and your buddy is super psyched to join and explore the contents therein, but there's a problem. This server is gated and requires verification before you join and get access to channels. Like a photo ID/Passport &amp; a 2FA code from an external app associated with your hobby. What to do!? Should they risk giving this server that <em>might</em> be cool personally identifiable info in order to join and partake?</p>\n<p>But wait, what if you could verify your identity using external accounts associated with your community, and get a server role that corresponds with your external account?</p>\n<p>Our experts say “that might be pretty cool” ┐('～`;)┌. So introducing our new and improved Connections from Discord!</p>\n<h2><strong>Overview (◕‿◕)</strong></h2>\n<p>Our new connections features give users the ability to connect external identities/accounts to your Discord profile. This will allow other users to verify the authenticity of your account via an icon on your user profile. Connections also enable admins to create roles and gated access with “Linked Roles”. In the past, connections only allowed certain special features, like being able to see what music someone’s jamming to from their Spotify.</p>\n<p>Moving forward, Connections can now act as a form of cross-platform verification you can apply to your account to access certain role-locked content in a server.</p>\n<p>For example, if you’re a dev you could build a linked role for Warhammer 40K Darktide that adds you to matches requesting your favorite class (Ogryns FTW BTW!!). Or make an app that connects you with other peeps who have similar game libraries.</p>\n<p>Are you a user and have a Steam, Epic, or Paypal account? Well, you’re in luck. Because now you can use those verified accounts to prove your account is the real deal on Discord to other users and admins. And if you have multiple external accounts that can be connected, you can even pick which connection you’d like displayed on your profile.</p>\n<h2><strong>What’s in this for Developers? ┬┴┬┴┤( ͡° ͜ʖ├┬┴┬┴</strong></h2>\n<p>For our developer community, we also opened up the Role Connections API for all developers to build any connection they want, to enable trust in their own way in their individual communities.</p>\n<p>You might be wondering how it works. In essence, Developers can use this new feature to build safer and more tight-nit communities by binding entry and access to servers and channels to verified roles. These roles could be more common like Paypal or eBay. Or be community or interest-specific like connections to Deviant Art, Steam, or Crunchyroll. Either way, with our new and improved connection features you’ll have the opportunity to help protect communities better by making access exclusive to those who can confirm they are a part of your clique.</p>\n<h2><strong>Where to learn more __φ(．．)</strong></h2>\n<p>So if you want to make your app more useful, or help keep your favorite community safe our new suite of features can help make your vision happen.</p>\n<p>To learn more, please check out our developer portal <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here.</a></p>\n<p>Our code lab so you can practice <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/tutorials/configuring-app-metadata-for-linked-roles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>As well as this nifty in-depth guide to building connections via our help center article <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10852186730903\">here</a>.</p>"

As Discord continues to grow and support our developers, it’s important to be transparent about the responsibilities and expectations of our developers and their Applications. <span class=\"s3\">This document sets forth the policies developers will need to follow to develop and operate their Applications</span>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\">Introduction</h2>\n<p class=\"p4\">This Discord Developer Policy is incorporated into the <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/terms-of-service\"><span class=\"s4\">Discord Developer Terms of Service</span></a> (“Developer Terms”) and you agree that it applies to your access to and use of our APIs in addition to the Developer Terms and other Terms. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein (including API Data and Application) have the meaning assigned to them in the Developer Terms. For clarity, the term “including” as used herein means “including without limitation.”</p>\n<p class=\"p6\">Please check back here regularly as we may update these policies from time to time and your continued access to or use of the APIs after such updates go into effect means you accept and agree to them. Additional terms and policies may also apply to your access to or use of certain APIs (including as described in or available via our <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro\"><span class=\"s4\">Developer Portal</span></a> or <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/categories/360000656491\"><span class=\"s4\">Help Center</span></a>).</p>\n<h2 class=\"p5\">Protect Discord users</h2>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li4\">\n<strong>Do not modify a Discord user’s account without explicit permission from the Discord user. </strong>Functionality that intends to make any changes to a Discord account, for example adding the account to a server, must clearly and properly inform the Discord account owner of the changes and receive explicit permission to enact the changes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">\n<strong>Do not collect, solicit, or deceive users into providing user login credentials. </strong>Under no circumstances may you or your Application solicit, obtain, or request login credentials from Discord users in any way.

provided that you may also use API Data for the purpose of improving your Application only if it has been aggregated or de-identified such that it cannot be associated with, or used to identify, any individual. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li8\">\n<strong>You may not mine or scrape any data, content, or information available on or through Discord services (as defined in our </strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\"><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></span></a><strong>).</strong>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li8\">\n<strong>Do not use API Data to</strong>: profile Discord users, their identities, or relationships with other users; to discriminate against anyone based on personal or protected classifications as defined in our <a href=\"http://dis.gd/guidelines\"><span class=\"s4\">Community Guidelines</span></a>; or for eligibility considerations for benefits or for purposes such as employment, housing, insurance, or otherwise.</li>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\">Furthermore, you may not, and may not use your Application, to obtain API Data or transmit data to Discord (i) of persons under the age of 13 or the relevant age of digital consent in their jurisdiction (if older) or (ii) that includes protected health information, financial information, or other sensitive information under applicable law, except to the extent specifically allowed by our terms for a given Discord service or necessary to process a financial transaction as specifically enabled by a Discord service;</li>\n</ul>\n<li class=\"li8\"><strong>Do not disclose API data to any advertising network, data broker, or other advertising or monetization related service.</strong></li>\n<li class=\"li8\">\n<strong>Do not sell, license, or otherwise commercialize any API Data or Discord services (as defined in our </strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\"><span class=\"s4\"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></span></a><strong>, e.g., Nitro subscriptions).</strong><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li8\"><span class=\"s3\"><strong>Do not direct your Application to people who are under the age of 13 or the minimum age of digital consent in their applicable countries.</strong> Our services are only for people who are at least 13 years old and meet the minimum age of digital consent in their applicable countries.</span></li>\n<li class=\"li8\"><strong>Do not attempt to re-identify, de-anonymize, unscramble, unencrypt, or reverse hash or reverse engineer API Data from the form in which you obtain it.</strong></li>\n<li class=\"li12\">\n<span class=\"s5\"><strong>Do not use API Data in any way that goes against Discord users’ expectations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong> This includes </span><span class=\"s3\">frequently sending unsolicited direct messages, sending direct messages not directly related to maintaining or improving an Application's core functionality, or making unsolicited changes to user data or to a user’s access to Discord services.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p6\">For the avoidance of doubt, the above policies apply in addition to the terms relating to API Data described in the Developer Terms (including Section 5 (User Privacy and Security)), and use of data includes how you access, collect, store, retain, transmit, share, and otherwise process it.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p7\">Apps Should Provide a Positive, Quality Experience</h2>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\">\n<strong>Do not use the API for any dangerous or illegal activity. </strong>This includes, but is not limited to, activities that facilitate or promote:</li>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\">Death, bodily harm, and/or personal injury;</li>\n<li class=\"li8\">Environmental damage (such as the operation of nuclear facilities, air traffic control);

Prohibited behaviors and activities include those that:</li>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\">Defraud users;</li>\n<li class=\"li8\">Deceive users via impersonation (outside of clearly labeled satire, parody, or fan accounts), including impersonating other Applications, Discord employees or partners, or Discord services.

You may not automate messages to be sent for the purpose of maintaining message activity in a Discord community.</li>\n<li class=\"li8\">\n<strong>Do not contact users outside of Discord without their explicit consent</strong>. This means you should not contact Discord users outside of the Discord platform by using any API Data (including any data obtained, disclosed, or inferred through a user’s use of your Application).</li>\n<li class=\"li8\">\n<strong>Do not enable your developer team, Application, or other users to bypass or circumvent Discord’s privacy, safety, and security measures</strong>. Your Application must respect user-initiated blocks, bans, kicks, mutes, visibility settings (such as users opting out of displaying connections or permission settings), and must not enable any form of masking account identities (such as obscuring Discord usernames).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"p7\">Respect the Platform</h2>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\">\n<strong>Obtain consent before initiating processes on a user or server’s behalf. </strong>Your Application must respect user decisions to opt out of or block the Application, as applicable. On the server level, your Application must respect server members’ (with the appropriate permissions) ability to remove the Application. The manner of providing the option for consent/authentication must be clearly labeled and apparent, and contain an accurate description of the purpose or feature being enabled. For example, if your Application is providing a service in response to a user initiated request or command, this is an acceptable instance of consent here.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li8\"><strong>Use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly make yourself or your team available for feedback or user support regarding your Application.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></li>\n<li class=\"li8\"><strong>Notify Discord and affected users of potential unauthorized access to API Data, as described in Section 5 of the Developer Terms.</strong></li>\n<li class=\"li8\"><strong>Do not remove, obscure, or alter Discord’s links to any of the Terms.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p6\">For the avoidance of doubt, the above policies apply in addition to the terms relating to use of the APIs in the Developer Terms (including Section 2).</p>\n<h2 class=\"p7\">API Limits</h2>\n<p class=\"p8\">As described in the Developer Terms, Discord may set and enforce limits on your use of the APIs (for example, by limiting the number of API requests that you may make, the number of servers your Application is in, or the number of users you may serve) at our sole discretion. You agree to, and will not attempt to circumvent, such limitations documented with each API.</p>\n<p class=\"p8\">If you would like to use any API beyond these limits, you must obtain Discord’s express written consent (and Discord may, at our discretion, decline such request or condition acceptance on your agreement to additional terms and/or charges for such use).</p>\n<p class=\"p8\">As described in the Developer Terms (including Section 9), we may take enforcement actions for any Enforcement Reason, including if we believe you or your Application have violated this Developer Policy. If you come across an Application that you believe violates any of these policies, please <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360005592534\"><span class=\"s4\">report it to us</span></a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p11\"> </p>"

Thank you for your interest in Discord’s APIs, software development kits (“SDKs”), and other developer products and services and associated software (including those described in or available via our <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference\"><span class=\"s1\">Developer Portal</span></a>) (collectively, \"APIs\" or “Developer Platform”).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These Developer Terms of Service (“Developer Terms”) apply to your access to and use of the APIs and set forth the legal obligations between us and you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When we say “Discord,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in these Developer Terms of Service, we mean Discord Inc., unless otherwise set forth in additional terms applicable to a given API.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When we say “Terms” in these Developer Terms, we mean, collectively, these Developer Terms, our <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro\"><span class=\"s1\">Developer Documentation</span></a> and any other applicable documentation we make available (“Documentation”), our <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy\"><span class=\"s1\">Discord Developer Policy</span></a>, our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\"><span class=\"s1\">Terms of Service</span></a> (including our <a href=\"https://discord.com/guidelines\"><span class=\"s1\">Discord Community Guidelines</span></a>), and any other applicable terms, policies, and guidelines we make available (including in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro\"><span class=\"s1\">Developer Portal</span></a> or <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us\"><span class=\"s1\">Help Center</span></a>). If there is a conflict between these Developer Terms and any additional terms, then these Developer Terms will control for that conflict. If you use other Discord services in connection with the APIs, then the terms for those other services also apply to you. Additional defined terms are described in Section 13 (Definitions) below.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Important Note: Section 12(e) (Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution) incorporates the </strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/terms#settling-disputes-between-you-and-discord\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>dispute resolution provision</strong></span></a><strong> from our </strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Terms of Service</strong></span></a><strong>, which includes an arbitration clause and class action waiver that applies to all U.S.-based Discord users. Please read this section carefully as it may significantly affect your legal rights, including your right to file a lawsuit in court.</strong></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 1: Acceptance of the Terms and Registration</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">a. Accepting the Terms</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">By accepting these Developer Terms of Service, creating or operating an Application, or otherwise accessing or using our APIs, you agree to comply with the Terms and that the Terms control your relationship with us. You also confirm and agree that (i) you are at least 13 years of age and meet the minimum age of digital consent in your country, and (ii) if you are not old enough to have authority to consent to the Terms in your country, that your parent or legal guardian must agree to the Terms on your behalf. If you are a parent or legal guardian, and your teenager accesses or uses the APIs, then the Terms also apply to you and you are responsible for your teenager’s activity. Please read all the Terms carefully.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You may not use the APIs and may not accept the Terms if you are barred from using or receiving the APIs under the applicable laws of the United States or other countries, including the country in which you are a resident or from which you use the APIs.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you are using the APIs on behalf of an entity, you represent and warrant that you have authority to bind that entity to the Terms and by accepting the Terms, you are doing so on behalf of that entity (and all references to \"you\" in the Terms refer to that entity).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. Registration &amp; Application Information</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You may be required or requested to provide certain information about yourself (such as identification or contact details or materials) and your Application (such as details about its functionality) as part of the registration process for access to the APIs (including when you create your Application), or as part of your continued use of the APIs (including in the Developer Portal or during App Review). You will ensure such information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date at all times. Without limiting the foregoing, you will maintain a clear and accurate description of your Application in its user-facing profiles. You will not misrepresent or mask your, or your Application’s, identity in the Developer Portal, as part of any registration process or App Review, or when using the APIs. We will use information about you to confirm your identity and as otherwise described in our <a href=\"https://discord.com/privacy\"><span class=\"s1\">Privacy Policy</span></a>.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 2: Use of the APIs</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">a. License to you</span></span>. Subject to your compliance with the Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-assignable, revocable license to access and use the APIs and Documentation we make available to you solely as necessary to integrate with, develop, and operate your Application to the extent permitted under the Terms (including the <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/policy\"><span class=\"s1\">Developer Policy</span></a>). We reserve all rights, title, and interest not expressly granted in the Terms and you may not access or use the APIs or Documentation except as set forth in the Terms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. Restrictions</span></span>. You will not (and will not attempt to or permit or enable others to): (a) reverse engineer or otherwise derive source code, trade secrets, or know-how from the APIs, except to the extent this restriction is prohibited by applicable laws; (b) modify, create derivative works, copy, reproduce, redistribute, rent, lease, sell, or syndicate access to the APIs; or (c) access or use the APIs in any way that (i) is not in accordance with the applicable Documentation, (ii) compromises, breaks, or circumvents any of our technical processes or security measures, (iii) poses a security vulnerability to users, us (including our systems or networks), or any third party, or (iv) exceeds any API rate, call, or other usage limits we set in our sole discretion (including as set forth in the Developer Policy or the applicable Documentation) or that we believe constitutes excessive or abusive usage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">c. Open Source Software</span></span>. Some of the software required by or included in our APIs may be offered under an open source license, as may be listed in the Documentation. Open source software licenses constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent the open source software license expressly supersedes the Terms, the open source license instead sets forth your agreement with Discord solely for the applicable open source software.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">d. Developer Credentials</span></span>. You will use any developer credentials (such as your Application ID, passwords, keys, tokens, and client secrets) we assign to you solely with your Application and the applicable APIs (and will not permit or enable any other Application to use them) and will treat them as Discord confidential information (as described below). Without limiting the foregoing, you will keep API keys and tokens encrypted in any files or other materials accessible by third parties (other than your Service Providers, subject to Section 12(a)). For the avoidance of doubt, developer credentials may not be embedded in open source projects.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">e. Eligibility</span></span>. As part of the APIs, we may make certain features available to you that require you to meet additional criteria in order to be eligible to access them (e.g., to enable your Application to be discoverable on or through Discord services). For the avoidance of doubt, your access to and use of such features will be subject to your compliance with the then-current applicable eligibility criteria and other policies (in addition to all other Terms).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 3. Use of App Content and Your Application</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">a. License</span></span>. You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to run, publicly display and perform, distribute, reproduce, modify, host, translate, store, and otherwise use your Application and App Content in connection with operating, developing, and improving the APIs and other Discord services; provided that the right to reproduce does not apply to the Application. This license is to allow us to, among other things: enable users to install and use your Application in Discord servers; display and provide information about you (including your name and Brand Features) and your Application to users (including in profile and product pages); frame and link to, place content around, and limit commands from your Application; make your Application discoverable by users on or through Discord services (including in search results, categories, and collections with other Applications); attribute you as the source of App Content; and analyze your Application and App Content for performance and compliance. For clarity, the things we do under this license will depend in part on your Application, App Content, and how you use the APIs. For example, if your Application is a bot integration that you host and deploy on your own, then we would not need to host your Application. This license will remain in effect with respect to App Content after the Terms end. We will not be subject to any terms or policies associated with your Application or App Content (even if we click to agree).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. Users</span></span>. You are solely responsible for your Application (including its development, operation, maintenance, support, distribution, use, and content). You will require users to comply with all applicable laws and regulations and the Terms (including our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\"><span class=\"s1\">Terms of Service</span></a>) in connection with their use of your Application (and will not permit or enable them to violate any of the foregoing). If you have a separate terms of service or other agreement to apply to users’ use of your Application, you agree (i) such agreement is solely between you and the user and we will not have any responsibility or liability thereunder and (ii) such agreement may not and will not supersede, modify, or be inconsistent with the Terms, which will supersede if there is any conflict or inconsistency with your agreement.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 4. Compliance with Laws &amp; Third-Party Rights<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">You and your Application will (and you will require those acting on your behalf and your users to): (i) comply with all applicable laws and regulations; (ii) not infringe or violate any third-party rights (including intellectual or other proprietary rights or rights of privacy or publicity); (iii) not access or use the APIs in a manner that is deceptive, unethical, false, misleading, or encourages or promotes illegal activity or infringement or violation of third-party rights; and (iv) not violate any other terms or policies with Discord.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You represent and warrant that you have obtained and will maintain all necessary rights (including from your users) to grant us the licenses, permissions, and other rights in the Terms (including those in Sections 3(a) and 8(d)) and to operate your Application (including to display, distribute, and provide all information, data, and other content therein).</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 5. User Privacy and Security</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">a. Implement Good Privacy Practices</span>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Without limiting Section 4, you will comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the ePrivacy Directive, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, Brazil’s Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (LGPD), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). You will provide and adhere to a privacy policy for your Application that is compliant with applicable privacy laws and clearly, accurately, and fully describes to users of your Application what data you collect, how you use and share such data with us and third parties, and how users can request deletion of such data. For the avoidance of doubt, how you use data includes how you access, collect, store, retain, transmit, share, and otherwise process it. You may only use API Data in accordance with your privacy policy, applicable laws and regulations, and the Terms. You agree that your privacy policy may not and will not supersede, modify, or be inconsistent with the Terms, which will supersede if there is any conflict or inconsistency with your privacy policy. You will maintain publicly available, up-to-date links to your privacy policy in the Developer Portal.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. API Data Sharing &amp; Retention</span></span>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You will not share API Data with any third party, except in the following circumstances, subject to compliance with the Terms and applicable laws and regulations: (i) with a Service Provider; (ii) to the extent required under applicable laws or regulations; and (iii) when a user of your Application expressly directs you to share their API Data with the third party (and you will provide us proof thereof upon request).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Except to the extent you are required to retain API Data under applicable laws or regulations, you will (1) promptly update the API Data upon request from us or the applicable user, and (2) promptly delete the API Data when: (a) retaining it is no longer necessary for your Application’s stated (and approved through App Review, as applicable) functionality that is permitted under the Terms; (b) you stop operating your Application (whether on your own, due to an enforcement action by us, or otherwise); (c) we request you delete it; (d) the applicable user requests you delete it; or (e) required by applicable laws or regulations. You will give users an easily accessible way to ask for their API Data to be modified and deleted. If you have received API Data in error, you will immediately tell us, delete it, and provide proof of deletion upon our request.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\">c. Implement Good Security</span>.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You will, and will require those acting on your behalf to, use commercially reasonable efforts to protect API Data from unauthorized access or use (including, for the avoidance of doubt, destruction, loss, alteration, disclosure, distribution, or other compromise). These efforts will include: (i) encryption of the data at rest and (ii) maintaining administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that are designed to prevent unauthorized access and use and comply with applicable laws and regulations (including relating to data security and privacy). You will promptly report to your users any unauthorized access or use of their data to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations. You will also promptly notify us and provide us with requested information about any incidents of unauthorized access or use of any API Data or any incidents that are reasonably likely to compromise the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your systems (or the systems of those acting on your behalf) that process API Data. In the event of any of the foregoing incidents, you will immediately begin to remediate it and reasonably cooperate with us, including by keeping us regularly updated about the incident and its impact on API Data, remediation actions being taken, and your compliance with any notification or other requirements under applicable laws and regulations.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 6: Monitoring &amp; App Review</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">The APIs are designed to help you enhance your Application. You agree to respond promptly to our requests to verify and audit your compliance with these Terms. YOU AGREE THAT DISCORD MAY MONITOR USE OF THE APIS TO ENSURE QUALITY, IMPROVE DISCORD APIs AND OTHER SERVICES, AND VERIFY YOUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE TERMS. You will not interfere with this monitoring. Discord may use any technical means to overcome such interference.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Without limiting the foregoing, we may also require that you submit your Application for our review and approval in various circumstances (e.g., to approve access to certain APIs or API Data, when use of your Application reaches certain thresholds, or to review compliance with the Terms) (“App Review”). You will cooperate with App Review and provide and maintain accurate and complete information as we request (including in the Developer Portal). If your Application has been approved through App Review, you will not materially change your Application’s functionality (including the scope of API Data you collect or how you use or share it) beyond its reviewed stated purpose, unless you first re-submit your Application, and receive our approval, through App Review.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Periodically, we may also request (including through the Developer Portal) information, certifications, and attestations relating to your access to or use of the APIs or API Data, which you will provide to us in the requested time frame and form and which you will ensure are accurate and complete. If you are an entity, such certifications and attestations must be provided by an authorized representative.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 7: IP and Confidentiality</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">a. IP Ownership and Feedback</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Discord does not acquire ownership in your Application, and you do not acquire ownership of any rights in our APIs, API Data, Documentation, or Discord confidential information or any derivative works of any of the foregoing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our APIs and API Data contain some third-party content (such as text, images, videos, audio, or software). This content is the sole responsibility of the person that makes it available and you are solely responsible for your decision to use or distribute any of this content. While we may sometimes review content to determine whether it is illegal or violates our policies or the Terms and we may remove or refuse to display content, we make no representations or warranties about the content or any decisions we make regarding it. Finally, API Data may be subject to intellectual property rights, and, if so, you may not use it unless you are licensed to do so by the owner of that API Data or are otherwise permitted by law. Your access to the API Data may be restricted, limited, or filtered in accordance with applicable law, regulation, and policy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">If you provide suggestions or other feedback about our APIs, Documentation, or any other Discord services, then you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicensable, transferable license to use the feedback and ideas generated from the feedback without any restrictions, attribution, or compensation to you.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. Discord Copyright and IP Policy</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We respond to notices of alleged IP infringement and terminate the accounts of repeat infringers according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4410339349655-Discord-s-Copyright-IP-Policy\"><span class=\"s1\">Discord’s Copyright &amp; IP Policy</span></a>. If you think somebody is violating your IP and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices in the foregoing policy.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">c. Confidential Matters</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our communications to you and our APIs may contain Discord confidential information. Discord confidential information includes any materials, communications, and information that are marked or designated confidential or that would normally be considered confidential under the circumstances (including any nonpublic information). Without limiting the foregoing, your participation in any research or feedback surveys or sessions or in any experimentation, testing, or use of APIs we make available to you that are not generally publicly available (including any information you receive, and feedback you provide us, in connection therewith) are Discord confidential information. If you receive any Discord confidential information, then you (i) will keep it confidential using no less than reasonable care to protect it and will only use it as necessary for your permitted use of the applicable APIs under the Terms and to provide us feedback, and (ii) will not disclose it to any third party without Discord's prior written consent, except to the extent (1) required by law with reasonable prior notice to us unless prohibited by court order or (2) necessary for a Service Provider to provide you services subject to Section 12(a).</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 8: Brand Features; Attribution</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">a. Brand Features</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">\"Brand Features\" means the trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, and other distinctive brand features of each party. Except where expressly stated, the Terms do not grant either party any right, title, or interest in or to the other party's Brand Features. All use by you of Discord’s Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to the benefit of Discord. All use by us of your Brand Features (including any goodwill associated therewith) will inure to your benefit.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. Attribution</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">All Applications will provide proper attribution(s) as required by Discord (including as may be described in the applicable Documentation). Subject to your compliance with the Terms, Discord grants you a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive license while the Terms are in effect to display Discord’s Brand Features for required attribution(s) or in an incidental manner while promoting or advertising your Application, only in accordance with the Terms and Discord’s Brand Guidelines. You understand and agree that Discord has the sole discretion to determine whether your attribution(s) and use of Discord's Brand Features are in accordance with the above requirements and guidelines.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">c. Publicity</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You will not make any statement (including in any promotions or advertisements of your Application) regarding your access to or use of the APIs which suggests partnership with, sponsorship by, or endorsement by Discord without Discord prior written approval in each instance.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">d. Promotional and Marketing Use</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use your name and Brand Features, your Application’s name and icon, and produce and distribute App Content and incidental depictions (including screenshots, videos, or other content) from your Application, in the course of promoting, marketing, or demonstrating the APIs or other Discord services you are using or your Application (including in our discovery surfaces). This license will remain in effect for existing materials and instances even if the Terms are terminated.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>9: Termination</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">a. Termination</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You may terminate the Terms by discontinuing your (including your Application’s and those acting on your behalf) access to and use of the APIs at any time with or without notice. Discord reserves the right to terminate the Terms with you, or discontinue, suspend, or limit the APIs or any portion or feature or your access thereto, if there is an Enforcement Reason or at our convenience upon notice to you. If there is an Enforcement Reason, we may, at our discretion, also take other enforcement actions, including the following: issue warnings or notifications to you or the users; identify and require or request corrective actions from you; remove, suspend, or limit your Application or App Content; remove any approval we have provided for your Application through App Review; remove badges we’ve issued to you or your Application; require you to stop using and delete API Data; terminate, suspend, or limit your user or developer account with Discord or your developer credentials; terminate your other agreements with Discord or your ability to use other Discord services; report you or your Application to law enforcement (as we deem appropriate); or take legal action or any other action we consider to be appropriate. Enforcement actions may be automated or manual and we may take them with or without notice to you, including while we investigate.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Without limiting any of the foregoing, we may also limit, suspend, or terminate your Application’s access tokens or any other means of access to the APIs that have not been used or accessed within at least the prior 30-day period, with or without notice to you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. Your Obligations Post-Termination</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Upon any termination of the Terms or discontinuation of your access to the APIs, you will (and will require those acting on your behalf to) immediately stop using the APIs and developer credentials, cease all use of the Discord Brand Features, and delete any cached or stored API Data you have in your possession or control or was otherwise collected by your Application, and all rights granted to you under the Terms (including in Sections 2 and 8(b)) will immediately cease. Discord may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with your Application and developer credentials to provide notice of the termination of your right to use an API.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">c. Surviving Provisions</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">When the Terms come to an end, those terms that by their nature are intended to continue indefinitely will continue to apply, including Sections 2(b), 3 - 7, 8(c) and (d), 9(b) and (c), and 10-13.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 10: Liability for our APIs</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">a. WARRANTIES</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">NEITHER DISCORD NOR ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, OR DISTRIBUTORS MAKE ANY SPECIFIC PROMISES ABOUT THE APIs, API DATA, DOCUMENTATION, OR ANY DISCORD SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE, WE DON'T MAKE ANY COMMITMENTS OR WARRANTIES ABOUT THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS OF THE APIs OR THE RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY, ACCURACY, QUALITY, APPROPRIATENESS, LEGALITY, ORIGIN, SAFETY, USEFULNESS, OR ABILITY TO MEET YOUR NEEDS OF THE APIs, API DATA, OR DOCUMENTATION. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE APIs WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, OR ERROR-FREE, AND WE MAY CHANGE, SUSPEND, OR DISCONTINUE THE AVAILABILITY OF THE APIs AT ANY TIME. WE PROVIDE THE APIs, API DATA, AND DOCUMENTATION \"AS IS\" AND YOU USE THEM AT YOUR SOLE RISK.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">SOME JURISDICTIONS PROVIDE FOR CERTAIN WARRANTIES, LIKE THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMS, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE EXCLUDE ALL WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND UNDERTAKINGS.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DISCORD, AND DISCORD’S SUPPLIERS AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR DATA; FINANCIAL LOSSES; OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE TOTAL LIABILITY OF DISCORD, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS, UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THE TERMS, INCLUDING FOR ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, IS LIMITED TO THE GREATER OF (I) AMOUNT YOU PAID US TO USE THE APPLICABLE APIS (OR, IF WE CHOOSE, TO SUPPLYING YOU THE APIS AGAIN) DURING THE SIX MONTHS BEFORE YOU FIRST ASSERT A CLAIM OR (II) $100 (OR THE EQUIVALENT IN YOUR LOCAL CURRENCY).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">DISCORD IS NOT LIABLE FOR THE CONDUCT OR CONTENT, WHETHER ONLINE OR OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF DISCORD SERVICES. IN ALL CASES, DISCORD, AND ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS, AND DISTRIBUTORS, WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY EXPENSE, LOSS, OR DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">c. Indemnification</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Unless prohibited by applicable law, you will defend (at our option), indemnify, and hold harmless Discord, and its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and users, from and against all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, fees (including legal and accounting fees), and expenses relating to:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">access to or use of the APIs or API Data by you, those acting on your behalf, your Application, or your users (including any incidents of unauthorized access to or use of API Data);</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">actual or alleged violation the Terms by you, those acting on your behalf, your Application, or your users;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">actual or alleged infringement of any third-party right (including intellectual property or other proprietary rights or rights to privacy or publicity) by you, those acting on your behalf, your Application, or your users; or</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">your Application, App Content, your Brand Features, or any content, data, technology, information, or materials provided or contributed by or through you, those acting on your behalf, your Application, or your users.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">You will not settle any claim without our prior written consent. We may, at our sole discretion, elect to assume control of the defense and settlement of any claim.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 11: International Transfers</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\">This section applies to the extent that the API Data includes personal data controlled by Discord Netherlands BV (“Discord EU Data”) and you transfer the Discord EU Data to a territory outside of the European Economic Area that, at the time of such transfer, does not have a positive adequacy decision from the European Commission under Article 45 GDPR (each, an “EEA Data Transfer”).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In each instance of an EEA Data Transfer, your use of Discord EU Data is subject to your compliance with the standard contractual clauses in European Commission Decision (EU) 2021/914 (“Clauses”) as they relate to controller-to-controller transfers as described in Module One.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In each instance, you agree that for the purposes of Section IV, Clauses 17 and 18 in the Clauses, Option 1 and Option (b) shall apply respectively and the Member State shall be the Netherlands. Nothing in this Section 11 (International Transfers) is intended to vary or modify the Clauses. For the purposes of the Appendix to the Clauses, the following will apply:</p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">For the purposes of Annex I(A) to the Clauses, Discord Netherlands BV is the \"data exporter\" and you are the \"data importer\" as defined in the Clauses.</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">For the purposes of Annex I(B) to the Clauses:\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">“Categories of data subjects” are the users who visit, access, use, or otherwise interact with your Application and the services of Discord Netherlands BV;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\"Categories of personal data\" are Discord EU Data, which includes profile information, communications between users, photos and videos, location information, information about use of your Application and other products and services, payment information, device information, information from third-party partners or Discord, or as otherwise set forth in the Discord Privacy Policy;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\"Sensitive data\" is personal data about a person's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade-union membership, genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation, criminal convictions or alleged commission of an offence;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\"Frequency of the transfer\" is on a continuous basis to the extent required to fulfill the purpose set forth in Section 11(b)(v) directly below;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">“Nature and purpose of the data transfer(s)\" is the provision of your Application by you to users pursuant to these Terms and your applicable terms and privacy policy; and</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">\"Period for which personal data will be retained\" is as described in the Terms and in any case not longer than necessary for a legitimate business purpose in accordance with the Terms and applicable laws or regulations (including rights of erasure and similar rights for individuals), unless applicable laws require the Discord EU Data be retained for a longer period, in which case you shall only retain such Discord EU Data for the period required by such applicable laws and subject always to Section 11(d) below.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">For the purposes of Annex I(C) to the Clauses, the competent supervisory authority will be the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>Dutch Data Protection Authority (<em>Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens</em>); and</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">For the purposes of Annex II to the Clauses, you will implement and maintain the technical and organisational security measures set out in the Terms, including those in Section 5 (“User Privacy and Security”) and such other measures as we may require from time to time.</li>\n</ol>\n<ol class=\"ol2\">\n<li style=\"list-style-type: none;\"> </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 12: General Provisions</strong></h2>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">a. Service Providers</span></span>. Before using a Service Provider, you will require them to first agree in writing to only access and use the APIs and API Data for you and at your direction to provide you services to develop or operate your Application in compliance with the Terms, and for no other purpose (including their own). For the avoidance of doubt, Service Providers are acting on your behalf. You will ensure that each Service Provider complies with the Terms as if they are in your place, and you are solely responsible and liable for their acts and omissions, including noncompliance. When you stop using a Service Provider, you will ensure they immediately cease using the APIs and API Data and promptly delete all API Data in their possession or control. Upon notice, we may prohibit your use of any Service Provider if we reasonably believe that they have violated the Terms or they are negatively impacting us, the APIs or our other services, API Data, or the users, and you will promptly stop using them.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">b. Modification</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We may change these Developer Terms from time to time. If we make a material change to these Developer Terms, we will provide you with reasonable notice prior to the change taking effect (e.g., at the email address or Discord ID we have on file for you or in the Developer Portal), unless the changes are urgent. If you continue to access or use the APIs or API Data after the changes have taken effect, it means that you agree to the changes. If you do not agree, you must stop using the APIs and API Data. You can review the most current version of these Developer Terms at any time by visiting this page.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">c. U.S. Federal Agency Entities</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The APIs and Documentation were developed solely at private expense and are commercial computer software and related documentation within the meaning of the applicable U.S. Federal Acquisition Regulation and agency supplements thereto.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s3\">d. Export Control</span></span><span class=\"s4\">. </span>You represent and warrant that you are not located in, or affiliated with the government of North Korea and are not included on any U.S. or E.U. list of prohibited or restricted parties. If you are located in any other country, including those subject to a comprehensive U.S. or E.U. sanction or embargo, your use of the APIs and any other Discord services must be in compliance with U.S. and E.U. laws and must not cause Discord to be in violation of such laws. If you request access to, download, or use any APIs that are not generally publicly available, you also represent and warrant that you are not located in Syria or the Crimea region of Ukraine, and are not affiliated with a government of such regions or the governments of Cuba or Iran. In addition, if your Application incorporates Discord software or SDKs, it may be subject to U.S. export controls governing its export, reexport, and transfer. You are responsible for determining the applicable restrictions and obtaining any necessary export approvals for your Application under the applicable laws. You may not permit your Application to be hosted, accessed, or used (i) in North Korea or by any U.S. or E.U. list of prohibited or restricted parties; or (ii) in any other country or region subject to comprehensive U.S. or E.U. government embargo (including Cuba, Iran, Syria, and the Crimea, Donetsk People's Republic, or the Luhansk People's Republic regions of Ukraine) unless that use is authorized by the U.S. and other relevant authorities, for example the general licenses issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control for services incident to the exchange of personal communications over the Internet (such as instant messaging, chat and email, social networking, sharing of photos and movies, web browsing, and blogging).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">e. Choice of Law; Dispute Resolution</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Subject to Section 11 above with respect to the governing law that applies to EEA Data Transfers, the <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms#settling-disputes-between-you-and-discord\"><span class=\"s1\">“Settling disputes between you and Discord” section in our Terms of Service</span></a> applies, where references to “the services” or “our services” will mean the APIs, “these terms” will mean these Developer Terms of Service, and the date for emailing an opt-out notice is within 30 days of October 1, 2022 or when you first create an Application, whichever is later.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-underline\"><span class=\"s2\">f. General Legal Terms</span></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To the extent permitted by law, we each agree to contract in the English language and if we provide a translation of the Terms, we do so for your convenience only and the English Terms will solely govern our relationship. The term “including” means “including without limitation.” The Terms do not create any third party beneficiary rights or any agency, partnership, or joint venture. Nothing in the Terms will limit either party's ability to seek injunctive relief. We are not liable for failure or delay in performance to the extent caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control. If you do not comply with the Terms, and Discord does not take action right away, this does not mean that Discord is giving up any rights that it may have (such as taking action in the future). If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms. The Terms are the entire agreement between you and Discord relating to its subject and supersede any prior or contemporaneous agreements on that subject. For information about how to contact Discord, please visit our <a href=\"https://discord.com/terms\"><span class=\"s1\">Terms of Service</span></a>.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">You may not assign, sublicense, or delegate any of your rights or obligations under the Terms (including any sale, license, or other transfer of ownership of your Application) to any third party without the prior written consent of Discord. Any assignment, sublicense, or delegation in violation of this provision is null and void. Any change of control or material ownership of you is hereby deemed an assignment. These Terms are non-exclusive. You acknowledge that Discord may develop products or services that may compete with, or are similar to, Applications or any other products or services.</p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\"><strong>Section 13: Definitions</strong></h2>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li1\">“APIs” (or “Developer Platform”) means, collectively, Discord’s APIs, software development kits (“SDKs”), and other developer services and associated software (including those described in or available via our <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference\"><span class=\"s1\">Developer Portal</span></a>).</li>\n<li class=\"li4\">“API Data” means any data, information, or other content you obtain through the APIs (including personal data).

        "body": "<p>You're probably wondering \"wow, what can I do with these cool new Message Content intents?\"</p>\n<p>Well, I'm excited to share that this article is not about that, let's learn what you can do even <em>without</em> the intent - how exciting.</p>\n<p>For those who didn't catch our <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-for-Verified-Bots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">announcement</a>, message content is officially becoming a privileged intent after August 31, 2022. Although message content can enable you and your bot to do a lot of things, there is still functionality that can take place without the intent. Here are some tips to help build common use cases without the need for the message content intent.</p>\n<p>First things first, please keep in mind that bots will always have access to message information in the following locations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>messages the bot receives in its DMs\n<ul>\n<li>Want to submit a ticket to the bot's devs or support server? Let them know!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>messages the bot is @mentioned in\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine a command prefix, but instead of a special character, it's the entire bot's name.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>messages the bot sends\n<ul>\n<li>Want to edit a cool leaderboard embed the bot sends at regular intervals? You still can!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your application is dealing with messages that fit any of the above three criteria, then it still has access to all of the content in the message.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Picture this:</strong> You have a crush on the bot. No matter how much you send messages in your server, the bot seems to be ignoring them. No problem, we're here to say you can ping them with @mentions or sneak into their DMs - that way you can <em>really</em> get their attention. Time to work up the courage and be more intentional!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As mentioned previously, if a bot is unapproved for the message intent, certain fields of the message object will return empty when <strong>receiving a message:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>content</li>\n<li>embeds</li>\n<li>attachments</li>\n<li>components</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Information from other gateway events like guild members and presences are still locked behind those intents though.</p>\n<p>We generally advise that if a function of your bot can be implemented in DMs or mentions without severely impacting the overall function or UX of your bot, to go for it instead of using the message content intent!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10327937393815\" alt=\"1.png\"></p>\n<p>An example where the GUILD_MEMBERS gateway is inaccessible, thus returning null on member. The same happens with GUILD_PRESENCES.</p>\n<p>Although not required, we are encouraging folks to look into alternatives and workarounds for their command functionalities wherever possible. Below are some examples on how some developers are still achieving common bot use cases without the intent!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Messages sent by the bot</h3>\n<p>Bots will always be able to read the data of messages that were sent by itself (not other bots, those are treated regular users). If you read your own message and didn't know <strong>who</strong> sent it, <strong>when</strong> you sent it, along with <strong>what</strong> it says.. bad example — okay you get my point.</p>\n<p>So maybe you have a leaderboard that updates itself every couple minutes to check the latest top runs of Super Mario Sunshine (2002) speedruns on the GameCube.</p>\n<pre><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green130\">// fetch the latest SMSS speedrun times from the API</span><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green130\">\nlet leaderboard = new Discord.MessageEmbed()\n\t.setAuthor(\"Super Mario Sunshine Speedrun LB\")\n\t.setFooter(\"Updates every so often\")\n\t.setTimestamp()\n\t\n\tconst lbData = await getStuff.fetch( =&gt; {\n\t\tfor (let counter = 0; counter &lt; result.length; ++counter) {\n        const { speedrunnerName, time } = result[counter]\n        let name = speedrunnerName\n        leaderboard.addField(`${counter + 1}) ${time} time`, `${speedrunnerName}`)\n    }\n\t});\n\nconst lbUpdate = async (client) =&gt; {\n\t// look for the previous leaderboard\n\tconst results = await lbData.find({})\n\t\tfor (const result of results) {\n\t\t\t// edit the leaderboard with newest data\n\t\t}\n\t// set a timer to edit\n}\n</span></strong></pre>\n<p>This is trying to demonstrate that if you were to log the embed data of all the runs currently in the leaderboard, the content (run times, speed runner names, etc.) would show up. So don't fret, your bot can still edit that message and it's contents with the fastest runs from the database of your choosing <strong>as long as the initial leaderboard message was sent by the bot</strong>!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Direct Messages</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Talking about <em>Direct Messaging</em> and message intents. This may be important regardless of whether a bot has DM scripts set up or not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A bot <strong>regardless of message intent approval</strong> will still have access to the data in messages received in DMs. Some of this data includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>author information (usernames, IDs, tags, avatar, etc.)</li>\n<li>message content</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Features like modmail, ticket systems, etc. can alternatively, wherever possible - be made with slash commands but we understand the potential difficulties with transitioning these specific functions to interactions.</p>\n<p>It is all the more important then that users know the implications of sending DMs to bot. We advise that bot developers' policies on this are very transparent, and that unless there are no workarounds, that there are opt-in mechanics to more safely handle message content.</p>\n<p>Generally, the information obtained from DM'd messages can only be stored if they are <strong>encrypted</strong> and <strong>made anonymous.</strong> Any data considered <strong>Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong> should only be stored depending on how relevant it is to the major/proper function of the bot.</p>\n<p>We generally recommend that this information not be stored for extended periods of time and that folks automatically delete unused data after 30 or so days.</p>\n<p>Additionally, message contents can only be stored for long periods of time for specific use cases that would be subject to more thorough review by the review team.</p>\n<p>Maybe a user wants to submit a ticket to your support server. Here's a simple way of doing something like that with direct messaging:</p>\n<p>1. Listen for when someone wants to create ticket.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green130\"><strong>// createTicket slash command is fired up\nif (interaction.commandName == \"ticket\") {\n\tclient.users.fetch(`${interaction.author.id}`).then(user =&gt; {\n\t\t\tuser.send('Type out your ticket below.');\n\t\t}\n\t)\n\t\tinteraction.reply('Check your DMs!')\n}\n</strong></span></pre>\n<p>2. Probably use some combination of message collectors to get ticket body, but let's keep it basic for now.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green130\"><strong>// get the bot's support server/channel to send the tickets to\nconst supportChannel = client.channels.cache.get(supportChannelID);\n\n// on any message event that isn't sent by a bot\nclient.on('messageCreate', message =&gt; {\n\t\t// author is still accessible\n\t\tif (message.author.bot) return;\n\t\t// DMs are a type of channel within the message\n    if (message.channel.type == \"dm\") {\n\t\t\t\t// create an embed message for the ticket\n\t\t\t\tconst embed = new Discord.MessageEmbed().setTitle('Support Ticket');\n\t\t\t\tembed.addField(\n\t\t\t\t\t`Sent by ${message.author.tag}`,`${message.content}.toString()`\n\t\t\t\t).catch(e =&gt; console.log(e));\n\t\t\t\t// send the embed\n        supportChannel.send(embed)\n    }\n});\n</strong></span></pre>\n<p>This example is of a bot that is constantly listening for messages sent by DMs. The point here is to demonstrate that when a message is DM'd directly to the bot, it could still make an embed with the message content and send the embed to a support channel. With some additional configuration, it could only start collecting messages specifically after the <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\"><strong><code>/ticket</code></strong></span> command is invoked, or even chained responses.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>@Mentions</h3>\n<p>As indicated earlier, bots still have access to the contents and data of messages that they're mentioned in. Imagine being in a group chat with a bunch of people. You turn off your notifications because sometimes you just don't want or have any reason to read all of the messages sent within.</p>\n<p>Think of it this way: your crush, the bot, seems to be ignoring every message you send in the server. So you work up the courage by @mentioning them by name to get their attention. But unlike your crush, the bot will open up and read the contents of your message every single time - how great is that!</p>\n<pre><strong><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green130\">client.on('message', async (message) =&gt; {\n\tconst args = message.content.slice(prefix.length).trim().split(/ +/g);\n  const command = args.shift().toLowerCase();\n\n\tif (message.author.id == botID) return;\n\tif (!message.content.startsWith(`&lt;@botID&gt;`)) {\n\t\treturn;\n\t} else \n\t\tif (command === 'ping') {\n\t\t\treturn message.channel.send('pong');\n\t\t}\n});\n</span></strong></pre>\n<p>You know the drill. If you've got message-based prefixes for your commands, you most likely have some version of filter to make sure your bot is only reacting to the right things.</p>\n<p>Congratulations, now you're on a first-name basis with your bot! (F in the chat for the folks out there too shy to @mention their crushes.)</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this example covers @mentions as a replacement for the command prefix, but as long as the bot is @mentioned in a message AT ALL, it'll have access to the contents within. From the front, to the back of the message, and every where in between.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Interaction Series: <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slash Commands</a>!</h3>\n<p>You can think of it this way: if your command doesn't need to know WHAT is being said or WHO sent the message, then it could likely be migrated to a slash command. These types of commands will likely have predefined results that do not change depending on data from the message.</p>\n<p>Interactions give you access to things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>interactionID (the ID of the interaction/command)</li>\n<li>applicationID (the bot ID this command belongs to)</li>\n<li>member (user who sent command)</li>\n<li>channelID (channel the command was sent from)</li>\n<li>guildID (guild the command was sent from)</li>\n<li>message (message the component/button is attached to)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: Don't use user reactions as buttons. Use the built-in message components like buttons.</p>\n<h3>A magic 8ball</h3>\n<pre><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green130\"><strong>client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction =&gt; {\n// not every interaction is a slash commmand\n\tif (!interaction.isCommand()) return;\n  if (interaction.commandName == \"8ball\") {\n\t\t// some random results from the 8ball\n\t\tlet replies = [\n\t\t\t\"Yes, of course!\",\n\t\t\t\"Perhaps not.\",\n\t\t\t\"Oh gosh, definitely not!\",\n\t\t\t\"This might be good.\",\n\t\t]\n\t\tlet random = Math.floor(Math.random() * replies.length);\n\t\tawait interaction.reply(`8ball results: &lt;@${interaction.member.id}&gt;! ${replies}[random]`)\n    }\n});\n</strong></span></pre>\n<p>The reason this type of command function still operates properly is because the action is relatively <em>static</em>. The final result will always be one of four replies, there isn't any message content or other factors that are influencing the result. Contrary to popular belief, the magic 8ball answers questions independent from user input.. yeah.. I know right..</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Interaction Series: <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#buttons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buttons</a>!</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10327893146903\" alt=\"2.png\"></p>\n<p>Buttons can be used for a plethora of different things, but we'll focus on a specific use case that could replace the need for message intents.</p>\n<p>Maybe you're thinking of beefing up the security/moderation of your server. Remember, even without the message intent, bots will know <em>when</em> someone sends a message, just not specifically <em>what</em> they said. Suppose you're picking up some suspicious behavior from a user then.</p>\n<p>How do you verify that they're not a bad bot or up to no good? That's right.. everybody's favorite - CAPTCHA.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green130\"><strong>/* after too many messages, prompt the user to click the correct\nbutton to verify they're human or something\n*/\n\n// pass in the message that triggered the captcha system\nfunction verify(message) {\n\t// get a random number between 1 - 10\n\tconst passBtn = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);\n\t// assign customIDs to ten buttons\n\tvar btn1 = new MessageButton().setStyle('PRIMARY').setLbael('1').setCustomId('1')..\n\t..\n\t..\n\t;\n\t// attach the buttons as components to a message\n\tvar row = new MessageActionRow().addComponents([btn1, ...])\n\t// notify the user the bot is awaiting their input\n\tinteraction.editReply({\n\t\tembeds:[new MessageEmbed()\n\t\t\t.setTitle('Verify your identity')\n\t\t\t.setDescription(`Click ${passBtn} button.`)\n\t\t],\n\t\tcomponents: [row],\n\t\tephemeral: true\n\t});\n\n\t// collect clicks only from the user who initiated the interaction\n\tconst filter = async (i) =&gt; {\n\t\treturn i.user.id === interaction.user.id &amp;&amp; i.isButton() &amp;&amp; i.message.author.id == client.user.id\n\t}\n\ttry {\n\t\tconst collector = interaction.channel.createMessageComponentCollector({\n\t\t\tfilter,\n\t\t\tmax: 1,\n\t\t\ttime: 1000 * 10,\n\t\t})\n\t\tcollector.on('collect', async (i) =&gt; {\n\t\t\tif (passBtn === icustomId) {\n\t\t\t\t// user pressed the right button\n\t\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t\t// user did not press the right button\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t})\n\t} catch (e) {\n\t\t// something just borked\n\t}\n}\n</strong></span></pre>\n<p>When a user clicks a button, the bot will receive an interaction (i) with data like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>when a button was clicked</li>\n<li>which button was clicked</li>\n<li>who clicked the button</li>\n</ul>\n<p>— from which the bot can do a bunch of stuff.</p>\n<p>Suppose the captcha generated the number '5'. Instead of requiring the user to type in their response, the user is prompted to click the button with the same <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\"><strong><code>customID</code></strong></span> (a developer-defined string of a max 100 characters) as the randomly generated number, in this case, '5'. The bot can then compare the clicked button's <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\"><strong><code>customID</code></strong></span> with the \"captcha\" number.</p>\n<p>In the above example, the message is invisible (ephemeral) to other users and there is a filter ensuring that it's only accepting clicks from the correct user. You could even achieve this entire interaction in DMs!</p>\n<p>If you're making something that operates off multiple choices, maybe a questionnaire, poll or something - check out buttons. We've seen folks in the past use reactions and collectors in a similar way, consider switching to interactions to do the same thing.. but better!</p>\n<p>Let your creativity go wild! We're excited to see what you come up with.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Interaction Series: <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#select-menus\">Select Menus</a>!</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/10327893221143\" alt=\"3.png\"></p>\n<p>Similar to buttons - maybe you'd like for users to select from a list of roles to be a part of? Instead of having to join them into the roles manually, users are able to do it with commands following tagging the name of the role! Oh.. but that requires multiple text inputs...</p>\n<p>Well, do we have good news for you.</p>\n<pre><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-green130\"><strong>client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction =&gt; {\n\n\t// slash command roles\n\tif (interaction.commandName === 'roles') {\n\t\tawait interaction.reply({\n\t\t\tcontent: 'Loading roles list..',\n\t\t\tephemeral: true\n\t\t});\n\t\t// add three roles as the possible options\n\t\tconst row = new MessageActionRow()\n\t\t\t.addComponents(\n\t\t\t\tnew MessageSelectMenu()\n\t\t\t\t\t.setCustomId('roles')\n\t\t\t\t\t.setPlaceholder('no role selected')\n\t\t\t\t\t.addOptions([\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel: 'House Bravery',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Unflinching, unyielding.',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'brave',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temoji: {}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel: 'House Brilliance',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Bot development, research',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'brilliant',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temoji: {}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t\t{\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tlabel: 'House Balance',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdescription: 'Inner peace, outer harmony.',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tvalue: 'balanced',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\temoji: {}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t},\n\t\t\t\t\t]),\n\t\t\t);\n\t\tawait interaction.editReply({\n\t\t\tcontent: 'Select a role to join!',\n\t\t\tcomponents: [row]\n\t\t});\n\t}\n\n\t// listen for an interaction with the customId for roles selection\n\tif (interaction.customId === 'roles') {\n\t\tawait interaction.update({\n\t\t\tcontent: 'A role was selected',\n\t\t\tcomponents: []\n\t\t});\n\n\t\t// reply to the interaction by changing the role\n\t\tinteraction.reply(someFunction)\n\t\treturn;\n\t}\n\n});\n</strong></span></pre>\n<p>When firing up the <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\"><strong><code>/roles</code></strong></span> command, the bot sends a message asking the user to make a selection from the dropdown box. In the dropdown will be a list of roles (up to 25) featuring the name of the role, a short description of the role, and maybe even a role icon for those looking for a little spice!</p>\n<p>When the user finishes making their choice by clicking out of the dropdown, the bot will receive an interaction. The bot will then have the value, id, user, etc. - all of the data with which to assign the corresponding role to the user.</p>\n<p>You could even allow users to make their selection and join roles from the privacy of their DMs by sending the interaction there as the interaction will also contain the guildID and even channelID from which the original command was used. Couple of additional steps with getting the role by guildID and voilà! — all that without having to type anything more than <span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red\"><strong><code>/roles</code></strong></span> .</p>\n<p> </p>\n<hr>\n<h2>In Conclusion</h2>\n<p>..All this and we've only barely scratched the surface of what can be done with interactions. We hope this got some of those mind juices flowing - there are so many use cases that we didn't cover that are possible without message content. Of course, we can't just have all the fun ourselves so we're excited to see what you can come up with. We built interactions to help users more easily engage with bots and hope to continue to see the same creativity, effort, and passion put into making servers just that much more enjoyable.</p>\n<p>You can read more about interactions/application commands: <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>You can read over our announcement about message content: <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-for-Verified-Bots\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>"

This will display information from the last time you clicked “Save changes” on your product Page tab.</p>\n<p><strong>A few things to note:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The only Discord user who can see your preview page is you! (<em>If you’re on an app’s team, anyone on the team can see the preview</em>).</li>\n<li>You will still be able to preview your app product page even before you have met the eligibility requirements on the checklist in the Discovery Status tab. (<em>However, note that your app must be at least verified to see this 'App Directory' section of the Developer Portal.</em>)</li>\n<li>We encourage you to make the most of all these available fields - think about how you want your app to look and feel to users who will visit your page and consider adding it to their servers. Not all of these fields are required, but we encourage you to fill out all you can and take advantage of them. Below is an example for inspiration:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/6485929997847/preview_2.png\" alt=\"preview_2.png\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FXA887YTR39C54BWHYCX9S86\">How to use the Discovery Status tab</h2>\n<p>This highlights <strong>everything in the Developer Portal that you need to complete in order to be eligible to opt-in to Discovery</strong>.</p>\n<p>The button (”Enable Discovery”) will not be clickable until all requirements are met.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/6485931000343/2.png\" alt=\"2.png\"></p>\n<p>Some of these inputs live in the new product Page tab, and some are elsewhere. See below for a walkthrough of all eligibility criteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Requirements in order to view the App Discovery page</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>App Verification:</strong> Your app has to be verified</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Required fields from the product Page tab</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Support Server</strong>: You must have a link to a Discord server in this field.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Application Description</strong>: You must have a description for your app. This is an opportunity to tell users who come across your app what the main functionality and benefits of your app are! We recommend putting the most important information up top, as succinctly as you can - and then going into more details if you want to say more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Required fields elsewhere in the Developer Portal:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Tags</strong>: You can add up to 5, but you need at least 1 tag added about your app in order to be eligible for the App Directory. These are added in the <strong>General Information tab</strong>.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Install URL</strong>: You can define this under the OAuth3 URL Generator section of the Developer Portal.

        "body": "<p>Recently, we've had to make a policy change which restricts users under 16 from verifying their bots on Discord alone. We created this article to explain what verification is and how you can help a young developer verify their bot and continue to grow their software, whether you're a parent, a friend, a guardian, or otherwise.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-a-verified-bot\">What is a verified bot?</h2>\n<p>At Discord, we want to foster unique communities where users can make a special space online that feels like theirs and theirs alone. Our API and developer tools allow developers both aspiring and established to contribute to those communities and craft awesome software that people can use to make their Discord server feels like home. To foster that creativity and keep our users safe, we launched a verification program, which asks developers operating bots of a certain scale to submit their bot for identity verification and general review.</p>\n<h3 id=\"which-bots-qualify-for-verification\">Which bots qualify for verification?</h3>\n<p>Bots begin qualifying for verification once they're in 76 servers or more. Bots are required to be verified in order to join over 100 servers. Qualifying developers will receive a direct message on Discord informing them when their bot is ready for verification.</p>\n<p class=\"callout\">More information on the verification process is available <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6206007597207\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-are-the-requirements-for-verification-whats-changing\">What are the requirements for verification? What's changing?</h3>\n<p>Any verified bot will be asked to submit a qualifying identity document and a comprehensive form asking for details about their bot's operation. We want to ensure that developers operating software at scale are real and trustworthy, and that we know more about how their software works on our platform.</p>\n<p>Previously, qualifying identity documents could come from any user who was of age to use Discord in their region, as documented <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040724612-Why-is-Discord-asking-for-my-birthday-\" target=\"_self\">here</a>. However, due to some legal concerns on behalf of our identity verification partners at Stripe, we've had to make a policy change regarding the age of verified developers. As of <strong>April 12th, 2021</strong>, only the identity documents of those <strong>16 and older</strong> will qualify for verification, regardless of region.</p>\n<p class=\"callout\">We've posted a comprehensive article on these changes <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/6276106082583\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">here</a>, and we encourage you to review that article for more information on the new verification age policy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-does-this-mean-for-developers-under-16\">What does this mean for developers under 16?</h2>\n<p>This policy change means that users under 16 can no longer verify their bots on their own, even if they're old enough to use Discord in their region. We want to ensure that young developers are able to foster a lifelong love of programming through their work on Discord, and so we've encouraged these developers to work with a qualifying partner to help them get verified. This can be anyone a young developer would trust to help them make cool stuff—a friend, a co-developer, a programming teacher, or a parent or legal guardian. As long as you are 16 or older, and are willing to speak on the developer's behalf and work with them going forward, you can help a young developer verify.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-help-a-developer-under-16-verify-their-bot\">How do I help a developer under 16 verify their bot?</h2>\n<p>To help a developer under 16 verify their bot, you'll need to first create a Discord account. You can learn how to create your own Discord account <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360033931551-Getting-Started\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Once your account is created, work with the bot's developer to complete the following steps!</p>\n<h3 id=\"creating-a-developer-team\">Creating a Developer Team</h3>\n<p>First, the bot needing verification will need to be part of a Developer Team so its ownership can be split among multiple users and can be easily transferred between people.</p>\n<p>To do this, the bot's developer will visit the <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/\" target=\"_self\">Discord Developer Portal</a> and create a Developer Team using the Teams tab. From that new team's page, the developer can then add anyone they would like to their new team, including your account, by typing the relevant username and four-digit discriminator into the invite field. You'll then need to check your account email for an invite message and accept the team invite to proceed.</p>\n<p>Once the Team has been created and you've been added to it, the developer will transfer their bot to that new team from the bot's page in the Applications tab using the Transfer App to Team button in the bottom right of the page.</p>\n<p>Finally, the developer will want to transfer their Developer Team's ownership to you using the Transfer Team Ownership button on the team's page in the Teams tab.</p>\n<h3 id=\"applying-for-verification\">Applying for Verification</h3>\n<p>Now that you're the owner of the Developer Team, you can begin the application process to verify the bot! With the bot's developer on hand, visit the Applications tab in the sidebar, then select the bot in question and click the verification link at the top of the page.</p>\n<h4 id=\"submitting-an-id\"><strong>Submitting an ID</strong></h4>\n<p>First, you'll need to submit your identity to our partners at Stripe. This can be done from a PC or a mobile device. You'll want to take a well-lit, unobstructed, and unedited picture of your identity document for submission.</p>\n<p>Stripe is an established processor of payments and identity information, and we've trusted them for years with identity verification and payments for our subscription services like Nitro and server boosts. They accept a wide variety of identity documents! Many of them are listed in their documentation here.</p>\n<p>If you're unsure whether your identity document is accepted, you can contact our Support Team at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://dis.gd/contact</a>, or ask in the Discord Developers server at <a href=\"https://discord.gg/discord-developers\" target=\"_self\">https://discord.gg/discord-developers</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"filling-the-form\"><strong>Filling the Form</strong></h4>\n<p>Once your ID has been verified by Stripe, you'll return to the Developer Portal and fill out the relevant form. You'll want to work with the bot's developer to fill out this form and provide the best possible answers! If the developer isn't sure how to answer a question, they can read more about the verification process here, or they can join our Developers server to get answers from both our staff and from other verified developers.</p>\n<h4 id=\"waiting-for-review\"><strong>Waiting for Review</strong></h4>\n<p>Once the form is submitted, a ticket is created with our verification team. Verification applications are typically reviewed within 4-5 business days, though the wait time can occasionally vary based on the current number of applications.</p>\n<p>When our team has an update on the verification status, be it an approval, a question, or a denial, you'll receive an email at the address tied to your Discord account. You can also reference your account's tickets by logging in on our support page <a href=\"https://dis.gd/mytickets\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Make sure to work with the bot's developer to review the email our team sends you. These often have important information or questions that require answers to proceed, so please make sure they're there to see the email with you!</p>\n<p>If you have concerns about a specific verification in process, feel free to visit our Developers server at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discord.gg/discord-developers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://discord.gg/discord-developers</a> to ask a staff member for more information!</p>\n<h4 id=\"after-verification\"><strong>After Verification</strong></h4>\n<p>Once a bot is finally verified, the bot's developer can take ownership of the team once again. You can transfer it back to them at any time from the Teams tab in the Developer Portal using the Transfer App to Team button.</p>\n<p>You'll want to maintain your Discord account, and you'll want to stay on the bot's developer team. If we have questions or concerns about the bot's operation at any time, we'll send them to the email address associated with the team's current owner.</p>\n<h2 id=\"why-do-you-need-an-id\">Why do you need an ID?</h2>\n<p>Our partners at Stripe review identification documents during the verification process so we can ensure those operating bots at scale are real individuals who can be accountable for their bot's operation. This helps us foster an innovative and unique developer ecosystem while keeping our users safe from bad actors.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-handles-my-information\">Who handles my information?</h3>\n<p>Our partners at Stripe act as our identity verification provider. Stripe is legally and contractually obligated to only use the data in a way that we’ve approved, which is to provide the service of identity verification. The data still comes from Discord and still belongs to Discord, and so we have the right and ability to remove that data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"who-can-see-my-information\">Who can see my information?</h3>\n<p>A small number of Discord employees (as in, fewer than ten) who are involved in security and legal will be able to access the information. The information is not stored on Discord itself and is not generally accessible to employees outside of this group. We understand that this is highly sensitive, and access to the information is not something that we take lightly. It is expressly for the use case of bad, bad actors. We’re not talking about general Trust and Safety concerns, like spambots or a bot deleting channels in a server. Instead, we’re looking to prevent data breaches, wide-scale privacy violations, and illegal activity.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-you-delete-my-id\">Can you delete my ID?</h3>\n<p>We can only delete your verification data after your verified bot is deleted. Removing information upon demand defeats the purpose of verifying identity. At the same time, we have no interest in keeping this data longer than we need to, and we want to balance those two principles. As such, our retention policy is that we'll remove the identification information a year after the bot that it is connected with has been deleted.</p>\n<p>This is in line with industry-standard retention guidelines for anti-abuse and anti-fraud situations. Keeping information after bot deletion for some amount of time is absolutely necessary — as we know in the security world, some misdeeds don't come to light immediately, and we want to make sure that we can take the steps to keep users safe.</p>\n<p>In case you're curious about the legal front, use of data for this purpose is outlined both in the GDPR (see Recital 47), as well as the CCPA (Cal Civ Code § 1798.105(d)(2)).</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-censor-part-of-my-id\">Can I censor part of my ID?</h3>\n<p>We need to see your complete and unedited ID in order to verify your identity. Keep in mind that we accept a variety of identity documents, some of which contain less information than others, so you can always consider using one of the alternative options. If you're ever uncertain, please contact us at <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://dis.gd/contact</a> and we'd be happy to help further.</p>\n<h4 id=\"im-in-the-netherlands-what-about-kopie-id\"><strong>I'm in the Netherlands. What about KopieID?</strong></h4>\n<p>Our partners at Stripe fully comply with KopieID recommendations, and we can process IDs that are edited using the official KopieID app. You can download that app here: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-slab-linktype=\"text\">https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/identiteitsfraude/vraag-en-antwoord/veilige-kopie-identiteitsbewijs</a></p>\n<h3 id=\"i-have-additional-questions\">I have additional questions!</h3>\n<p>If you have any additional questions about the verification process, we're here to help.

The limit for invalid requests is currently 10,000 per 10 minutes. However, if your bot gets temporarily CloudFlare banned from the API, it is most likely <strong>not</strong> a global rate limit issue and is more likely a spike in errors that were not properly handled.</p>\n<p>First thing we want to note is that <strong>we, under very few circumstances, raise the global rate limit on applications</strong>. The good news is there are available workarounds that we encourage developers to look into when building their apps.</p>\n<p>We also want to mention that interaction endpoints are not bound to the rate limit. So migrating functionality to application commands where possible could be another solution. Definitely take a look at our docs on that <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands\">here</a>, or documentation for the library of your choice.</p>\n<h2>Gateway Rate Limits</h2>\n<p>To send data to/from Discord, your application connects to a websocket. <strong>Sharding</strong> is generally a best practice for applications especially as they continue to grow and scale on Discord. It’s a sure-fire way of working not quite around.. but within our API rate limits. Sharding opens multiple websockets so data can be exchanged across all of these connections rather than overloading one.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-jsx\">shard_id = (guild_id &gt;&gt; 22) % num_shards\n</code></pre>\n<p>Traffic from guilds/servers will be routed to a shard (open websocket) and their requests will run in parallel to each other to stay under the global rate limit. Think of sharding as splitting your bot into multiple instances of itself. It’s entirely user-controlled and is only made simpler by your library of choice!</p>\n<p>With regard to <em>large bot sharding</em> and an increased global rate limit, these are services we can only offer to bots that are operating in 150,000 servers or more. You can learn more about how these requests work in our documentation: <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding-for-very-large-bots\">https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding-for-very-large-bots</a></p>\n<p>You can read more about how to fine tune and configure shards <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding\">here</a>.</p>"

Note that unverified bots can use Privileged Intents without needing to apply; just turn them on from the bot’s page on the Developer Portal.</p>\n<p>If your bot is already verified, and you’d like access to a new Privileged Intent for your bot, have a look at the top of your bot’s settings page on the Developer Portal. You should see a button there to begin the process. If you don't see that and believe you should, please <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\">reach out to us via support</a>. Once you submit an application, a human will look at your submission and get back to you.</p>\n<p>When you apply for Privileged Intents, you'll be redirected to a questionnaire. We'll ask you a few questions including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which Intents you're applying for</li>\n<li>Your use case for those Intents</li>\n<li>Some data security and privacy questions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Providing thorough answers to these questions will help to ensure the best outcome for your request. Attaching screenshots or video can be especially valuable to help explain how your bot uses Privileged Intents.</p>\n<p>Access to Privileged Intents is approved or denied based in part on your bot’s use case for the information gated by the intent.

        "body": "<p>We're glad you asked! As with most things, it is up to the details of the implementation. Rather than list out every possible idea, or have you extrapolate on examples, here are some principles that guide the way we think.</p>\n<p>If you have questions about your particular use case, be as descriptive as possible in your application, and please feel free to <a href=\"https://dis.gd/contact\">reach out to our support team</a>, or talk to us in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/discord-developers\">Discord Server</a>! We're happy to talk you through the process.</p>\n<h2><strong>Meet User Expectations</strong></h2>\n<p>In general, a good principle of privacy is to ask yourself \"Would someone be surprised by this?\" If the answer isn't solidly \"no\", it might be worth evaluating.</p>\n<h2><strong>Practice Principles of Least Privilege</strong></h2>\n<p>The principles of least privilege state that you should only be asking for privileges that you fundamentally need. The Discord API is pretty vast, and there may be a better way to go about what you're trying to do. We'd love to have that conversation with you and help you think it through!</p>\n<h2><strong>Be Sensitive to What Info You Have</strong></h2>\n<p>Info from Discord comes in many shapes and sizes, and you have a large responsibility to be sensitive to what info you're getting and storing, especially with data from Privileged Intents. If you're using data that is fully anonymous and aggregated, ensure that access to that data is limited to only those who should be able to see it, be that in the context of your development team or privileges in a server.</p>\n<p>If you're using information about individuals, make sure you really take user expectations to heart, and provide users with a way to request deletion of that data. If functionality allows, delete user data that you store as quickly as you are able. 30 days is our gold standard if you need to hold onto the data for a while.</p>\n<p>Lastly, be sure to encrypt any personally identifiable information that you collect about a user. This includes email, phone number, address or any other information that could be traced to a user in the real world.</p>\n<h2><strong>Be Sensitive to Who Has Access</strong></h2>\n<p>Discord Servers are often private places. Even in public servers, though they're welcome for everyone to join, people have a sense that what they're doing is in <em>that</em> community, and not mirrored or copied somewhere else. Be mindful of who on your team has access to information, as well as under what privileges you show users access to it. For example, data about a specific server--even anonymous and aggregated--should probably be limited in access to just people <em>in</em> that server with proper permissions.</p>\n<p>We know this was a lot. If you have any questions about the process or requirements, please feel free to get in touch with us over at <a href=\"http://dis.gd/contact\">dis.gd/contact</a>, or come see us in our <a href=\"https://discord.gg/discord-developers\">Discord Server</a>! We want to help and ensure all of this is as painless as possible. Thank you for your hard work in helping keep Discord a safe place for everyone, and we can't wait to see your creation flourish!</p>"

This philosophy lead us to introducing privileged intents to the gateway, and lead us to adding Message Content to that list. In case you haven’t heard, starting August 30th, 2022, Message Content will become a privileged intent. You can read that announcement <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055\" target=\"_self\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>This move allows us to ensure malicious bots can’t monitor user activity on the platform. It also introduces a problem, however. By far the most popular way to interact with bots is to send a message in a text channel with some signifier to denote the message as a command. These commands would no longer function without the message content intent. Slash commands were designed to simulate this functionality without an application needing to read messages, while improving upon the user experience of using one of these commands.</p>\n<p>The move to commands wasn’t just about security and privacy, we’ve also added a ton of functionality to bot commands built in at the platform level to give every bot easy access to things like role restrictions, localization and auto-complete.</p>"

If your bot is operating in fewer than 100 servers, this change doesn't impact you.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to ensure that message privacy is the default state of the world for bots operating at scale on Discord, and that message content access is only granted based on the need for a bot's core functionality. Message content access <strong>is not going away</strong>. There will always be unique, compelling, and transformative features that require access to messages in a server: from moderation to gameplay, to things we can't even imagine yet. Bots will continue to have access to any messages that specifically @mention them, as well as to DMs directly with the bot, regardless of message intent approval.</p>\n<p>If a bot operating at scale has access to messages in bulk, we have to ensure it has that access with good reason. Approval for message content also means that bot is using messages in ways that cannot be migrated to our newer interaction options. <strong>Handling message data is a huge responsibility and can greatly impact the privacy and safety of users on Discord.</strong></p>\n<p>Below, we'll explain what the different criteria mentioned above mean and why they're important to our thought process.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FJ9G3RTCBDCXCBEN59PTG195\">Criteria for Approval</h2>\n<p>We've rooted our approval philosophy in three basic tenets. We look for features that are <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\" data-reactroot=\"\">unique, compelling, </span>and<span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"3\" data-reactroot=\"\"> transformative</span>. Let's talk about what that means in general, and what it will mean for messages moving forward.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FJ9G3XGF17JTSSY9GMW90VRS\">Unique</h3>\n<p class=\"callout\">📝 We consider <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\" data-reactroot=\"\">UNIQUE</span> to be features that are <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"3\" data-reactroot=\"\">not currently available in any capacity within the client</span>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"0\" data-reactroot=\"\">If a feature you are building is something the client already does to some capacity, we likely wouldn't grant you intents approval for that feature.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Example:</strong> Let's use Guild Presences and activity data as an example of how we apply these criteria generally. When working with Guild Presences, and your only use case is to count how many users are online in a given server. The client already does this—you can just check the sidebar in any channel with @everyone access! Because the client does this near identically, we wouldn't consider your use case a unique one, and thus wouldn't grant you Presences access solely to provide that kind of feature.\n<ul>\n<li>Note that what features are \"unique\" can change as the client does. We reserve the right to deny or remove Privileged Intents when this functionality is exposed through the client.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FJ9G42JH1V3849KK3FRH9CCN\">Compelling</h3>\n<p class=\"callout\">📝 We think of <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\" data-reactroot=\"\">COMPELLING</span> as features that are <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"3\" data-reactroot=\"\">clear, self-explanatory, and immediately understandable why this feature should exist and where it would be useful</span>.</p>\n<p>Of all our criteria, features being considered compelling is perhaps the most nuanced, which is why we encourage you to share as much detail as you possibly can.</p>\n<p>Describe your features in-depth. Tell us why you think your features are cool, and why you think your users need them. We love it when you tell us stories about the software you're making, so tell us your stories!</p>\n<p>With that in mind, simply requesting approval for messages so you can maintain custom prefixes or traditional command interfaces will result in a denial, as we don't believe that to be a compelling use case on its own.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FJ9G47WXN5MFSBZBKC13VQB8\">Transformative</h3>\n<p class=\"callout\">📝 We consider <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\" data-reactroot=\"\">TRANSFORMATIVE</span> as <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"3\" data-reactroot=\"\">using the information you collect through message intents to provide new functionality or features.</span></p>\n<p>Just resurfacing the message content you're collecting in a new way generally isn't considered \"transformative\". Often, developers will request approval for intents simply so they can share user information, server data, or other statistics. For the most part, that kind of thing <em>isn't</em> transformative.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Let's use Guild Presences and activity data as an example of how we apply these criteria generally. If you're just displaying what someone's activity status is with some sort of !activity [user ID here] command, for example, that's simply recreating functionality that exists in the client. But, if you're looking at someone's activity data and acting on it in ways that the client can't, that'd be transformative. For example, a command that provides lyrics for a song mentioned in someone's Now Playing activity status.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FJ9G4DRZ22D1ZP0CKSADVGQW\">Non-Invasive</h3>\n<p>In addition to looking for features that are unique, compelling, and transformative, <strong>we also require that use cases respect user privacy and safety.</strong></p>\n<p>If you intend to collect user data to provide some degree of functionality, you must:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that you are complying with all relevant privacy laws. This includes <strong>clearly disclosing</strong> what data you collect and how you use it.</li>\n<li>Post a <strong>Privacy Policy</strong> publicly and make it accessible to users (and provide us with a link).</li>\n<li>Allow users to <strong>opt out</strong> of providing you that data, even if that means not being able to participate in the feature.</li>\n<li>Provide an accessible way for users to request access to and deletion of their data.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As a reminder, it's your responsibility to ensure that you have reviewed and comply with our Developer Terms, Developer Policy, Terms of Service, and Community Guideline.</p>\n<p><strong>Example:</strong> Let's use Guild Presences and activity data as an example of how we apply these criteria generally. Collecting a user's Presence information to gather a rough idea of what time zone they're in based on their time spent active on platform, without users volunteering that information to you themselves. The most invasive features are ones that are used to provide advertising and marketing within servers, which is explicitly disallowed by our <strong>Developer Policy</strong> already.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FJ9G4NPF3D3H07T1C77XHXKH\">Feasibility of migration</h2>\n<p>When reviewing requests for message content, we're going to consider the <strong>feasibility of migrating your stated functionality to interactions where possible</strong>. Our goal is to either maintain the functionality of those features that fit the above criteria as they exist now, or to help you migrate those features to interactions where possible.</p>\n<p><strong>If a feature cannot be migrated to interactions in any capacity and meets our other criteria, you'll likely get message content approval.</strong> If, however, a feature <em>can</em> be migrated to interactions with some degree of modifications to your user experience, we'll likely lean towards helping you migrate that functionality rather than granting you message approval.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FJ9G4TMMJDZFP3RYFPED7KE1\">Library Issues</h2>\n<p>When discussing the feasibility of migration, it's of course important for us to consider the impact of community-driven libraries and their adoption of our interaction options. We've been working with the libdev community since early summer to try and help them adopt interactions as quickly and smoothly as possible.</p>\n<p>That said, <strong>we won't be able to grant message intents in cases where your only blocker preventing migration is a lack of support for interactions in your chosen development library.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are on a library that does not support interactions, and your features are not otherwise unique or compelling enough to justify message intent approval, please consider exploring library extensions, alternative libraries, or alternative languages where possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Bots will continue to have access to any messages that specifically @mention them, as well as to DMs directly with the bot, regardless of message intent approval.</strong> If you're developing with a library that does not support migration to interactions, you can rely on this access as a fallback.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FJ9G50PSGEPPY4554SKGGR9Q\">Relevancy to bot</h2>\n<p>Our goal is to ensure that developers are only getting access to message content where it's necessary to provide features that are directly relevant to their users. With that in mind, for the message intent, we'll be a bit more discerning about whether or not a proposed feature is relevant to your bot's overall stated goals.</p>\n<p>Plan to explain why your bot in particular needs accesses to message content in order to enable that specific functionality.</p>\n<p class=\"callout\"><span class=\"wysiwyg-color-red110\">🛑 We reserve the right to re-review privileges and verification to any bot at random, on a periodic basis to ensure they are compliant with our policies. We may revoke verification for a verified bot if the bot changed significantly from the stated goals and purposes in the original verification application and has not been updated.</span></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FJ9G55R201JADEZ67HN4QKJM\">Impact to infrastructure</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Features that incentivize spam.</li>\n<li>Features that put undue load on our databases (e.g. hammering the same resource very fast forever).</li>\n<li>Features that incentivize selfbotting. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FJ9G59ZPXE36S1NHS5VCQSDD\">Reporting</h2>\n<p>If you find a bot that is not compliant with this policy, please report it to us by filling out the form here: <a href=\"https://dis.gd/report\">https://dis.gd/report</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FJ9G5EF2G3B511NEDFCQSP1Z\">Enforcement</h2>\n<p>This policy is enforced by our Developer Support team.

        "body": "<p>As the popularity and number of Discord bots grow, it's important to keep our users and developers safe and healthy. This means from time to time, like any maturing platform, we need to update our policies to reflect the current needs of the ecosystem.</p>\n<h2><strong>MESSAGE CONTENT IS BECOMING A NEW PRIVILEGED INTENT</strong></h2>\n<p>On <strong>August 31, 2022</strong>, access to message content will become a Privileged Intent—like presence and guild member data—for developers building or managing verified Discord bots and apps.</p>\n<p><strong>This change affects</strong> <strong>only verified bots</strong>, bots that are in 100 or more servers. Unverified bots in fewer than 100 servers are not affected at all.</p>\n<p>Developers should begin to update their apps to reflect these new requirements.</p>\n<p>Applications for requesting the intent began on <strong>Monday, Oct 25, 2021</strong>. During (and after) the transition period, developers can apply for access to message content in the same manner they currently apply for other intents: via the <strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro\">Developer Portal</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>On <strong>September 1, 2022</strong>, we will remove verified apps' access to message content if they have not been approved for the Privileged Intent.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, we've built out the <strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Interactions API</a></strong> to bring new features like <strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Slash Commands</a></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#buttons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buttons</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/message-components#select-menus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Select Menus</a></strong> that don't require access to message content. We recommend that developers who haven't yet leveraged these new tools begin to do so over the next nine months.</p>\n<h2><strong>WHO IS IMPACTED?</strong></h2>\n<p>This change applies only to <strong>verified bots and apps</strong>, which means those that are in 100 or more servers.</p>\n<p>We know developers rely on being able to test and iterate quickly, so unverified apps and bots will continue to be able to access message content without restrictions, just like presence and guild member data.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHAT WILL AN UNAPPROVED BOT LOSE ACCESS TO?</strong></h3>\n<p>If your bot or app is not approved for message content, the following fields of the message object in Gateway and API payloads will be empty—either an empty string or empty array, depending on the data type—when you <strong>receive</strong> a message:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>content</code></li>\n<li><code>embeds</code></li>\n<li><code>attachments</code></li>\n<li><code>components</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A bot can still <strong>send</strong> these fields. A bot will also <strong>always</strong> be able to get this information from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Messages the bot sends</li>\n<li>Messages the bot receives in DMs</li>\n<li>Messages in which the bot is mentioned</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You will still receive the events and can call the same APIs, and you'll get other data about a message like <code>author</code> and <code>timestamp</code>. To put it simply, you'll be able to know all the information about when someone sends a message; you just won't know <em>what</em> they said.</p>\n<p><strong>These restrictions will not apply to message objects received via interaction payloads</strong> (like buttons interactions).</p>\n<h2><strong>WHY IS DISCORD MAKING THIS CHANGE?</strong></h2>\n<p>As the popularity and number of Discord bots grow, it's important to keep our users and developers safe and healthy. Our existing policies require that developers only access information needed to provide their bots' functionality, and protect developer credentials and user data.</p>\n<p>For more sensitive data, we've taken further steps to keep that information protected and responsibly accessed. This is good for Discord users, who value their privacy, and for developers, who can focus their efforts on making great user experiences, and don't have to worry as much about access and security restrictions around data that they don't need.</p>\n<p>Presence and guild member information is already granted based on necessity after review; we believe that message content should be subject to a similar review and approval framework. Knowing that message content is central to certain bot functionality, we took the time to create appropriate replacements and preparations for granting access.</p>\n<p>We're continuing to invest in interactions as the future of bots, including new slash command option types, better moderation controls, and new types of interactions.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHAT ABOUT UNVERIFIED BOTS?</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Unverified bots and apps will not be impacted by this change</strong> and can continue to use message content in their bot development without requesting any Privileged Intent.</p>\n<h3><strong>HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE TO MIGRATE?</strong></h3>\n<p>We know change takes time, which is why we've created a lengthy transition period of <strong>nine months</strong> to help ease into the new changes. The transition period will end on <strong>August 31, 2022</strong>, and developers who foresee that they will need to request permission for this Intent can begin applying on <strong>October 25, 2021</strong>.</p>\n<p>We host virtual events and Q&amp;As which any developer can attend—as always, the best place to stay in the loop is our official <strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/4Yj6tMbDbg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Discord Developer server</a></strong>.</p>\n<h3><strong>WILL MY BOT BE ABLE TO READ MESSAGES IN DMs (DIRECT MESSAGES)?</strong></h3>\n<p>Yes, this change does not impact a bot's ability to access Message Content in DMs.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHAT ABOUT MODERATION BOTS?</strong></h3>\n<p>We know that many bots and apps function specifically to read, moderate, and otherwise manage messages sent by Discord users. We expect to grant those requests for message content without issue.</p>\n<p>If your bot has unique functionality that cannot be replicated or otherwise implemented with interactions, you can apply for the intent.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHEN CAN I APPLY FOR THE NEW INTENT?</strong></h3>\n<p>We expect most bots and apps to migrate to new ways of engaging with users, like slash commands and other interactions. Please bear in mind that only bots that perform unique behaviors (that cannot be performed by Interactions) will be eligible for this intent.</p>\n<p>If your bot has unique functionality that cannot be replicated or otherwise implemented with interactions, you can begin applying on <strong>October 25, 2021</strong>. You can apply directly from the form available in the Developer Portal. </p>\n<h3><strong>WHO WILL GET THE INTENT?</strong></h3>\n<p>We intend to grant message content approval for features that are unique, compelling, and transformative; non-invasive and put user privacy and safety front and center; relevant to the given bot's mission and existing feature set; and do not represent any significant impact to our infrastructure.</p>\n<p>You can read more about our review policy <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5324827539479\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF I REQUEST AN INTENT AND IT GETS DENIED?</strong></h3>\n<p>After the transition period has ended on <strong>August 31</strong>, <strong>2022</strong>, all verified apps' access to Message Content will be revoked unless they have been granted the Privileged Intent.</p>\n<p>As the name suggests, access to any special Intents is a privilege! We read all applications closely, and in certain cases will provide feedback for why your Intent request was not granted.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHERE DO I APPLY FOR MESSAGE INTENT?</strong></h3>\n<p>You can apply for the Message Content intent, along with our other privileged intents, <strong>directly through your bot's page in the Developer Portal</strong>. Note that this form will only be available if you are eligible to apply, i.e. if you are in 75 or more servers or are already verified).</p>"

It's a Discord bot whose primary purpose is to display statistics about a guild, or the members of that guild. This information can range from how many members a guild has over time, to how active certain channels are, to who are the most active guild members.</p>\n<p>We know that people who run communities love to know about what's going on in their server. This article is the policy that we ask all verified Statics Bots to adhere to in order to uphold Discord's commitment to user safety and data privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"guild-data-access callout\">Guild Data Access</p>\n<p>\"Guild Data\" is anonymous, aggregate data about the guild as a whole or channels within the guild. It includes but is not limited to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Growth/memberflow charts</li>\n<li>Activity of individual channels</li>\n<li>Voice/message velocity</li>\n<li>\"Activity\" data, like popular games</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Access to Guild Data must meet the following criteria:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Any data or dashboards must be default-private. This means that a user must be a member of the guild in order to see them.</li>\n<li>You may give server owners and admins the ability to mark their guild data as public.

Opting out via a web dashboard is insufficient.</p>\n<p>Remember, not all use cases are the same. You may see some bots that have been verified that toe the line; verification is a manual review process, and therefore a human has laid on eyes on every bot that passes through.

We use UTM parameters to help you track \"conversions on traffic\" you're sending to your Discord store page.</p>\n<p><strong>But why bother tracking conversions?</strong> Isn't it good enough to count the number of 'clicks' on a Google Ad or link in a Twitter post? Good questions! Link clicks will give you a sense for traffic but not all traffic is the same.</p>\n<p>When we drive traffic to Discord, one of the things we want visitors to do is register. For us, this is a type of \"conversion.\" When we looked at our own data, <strong>it was pretty common for our best source of traffic to NOT be our best source of registrations</strong> (i.e. maybe they were lower intent visitors). So, we track the percent of visits that turn into registration, or \"conversion to registration,\" to make sure that the time or money we spend on channels is worth it.</p>\n<p>When you drive traffic to your Discord store page, your \"conversion\" event would be a user acquiring the game. <strong>This guide will help you understand how to use UTM parameters to track conversions.</strong> You'll be able to measure things like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Did my one video on Youtube drive more purchases than all my effort (and $$$) on Google Ads?</li>\n<li>How do I compare this big-time influencer's post, which drove a lot of traffic, to this smaller streamer who drove less traffic but spent time showcasing my game?</li>\n<li>Facebook sends more traffic than Twitter to my Discord store page but is it really better at driving purchases?</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Quick Start</h2>\n<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Grab the link to your store page</p>\n<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Prepare your UTM parameters</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Decide the parameters for the 5 UTM fields: source, medium, campaign, term, and content.

We'll use BetaDwarf's Minion Masters as an example.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-1-grab-a-link-to-your-store-listing-page\">\n<strong>Step 1:</strong> Grab a link to your store listing page</h3>\n<p>You can find your link in the web app or by clicking the link icon in the desktop app.</p>\n<p><br><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360023675311/1.png\" alt=\"1.png\"></p>\n<p>In this case, the link to the Minion Master's store page is:</p>\n<p><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://discordapp.com/store/skus/488607666231443456/minion-masters\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://discordapp.com/store/skus/488607666231443456/minion-masters</a></p>\n<p>The problem with this link is when people visit we know nothing about where they came from! We'll fix this in Step 2.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-2-prepare-utm-parameters\">\n<strong>Step 2</strong>: Prepare UTM parameters</h3>\n<p>UTM parameters are a set of 'tags' that you can add on to the end of a link. It's a widely-supported system to help track where visitors to a website are coming from.</p>\n<p>Let's say you post a link to your Discord store page on your own website. To use an analogy, think of the link itself as an airplane bringing visitors to the destination: The Discord store page. The UTM parameters are like the baggage tags; they allow the destination to know where the visitor came from and how.</p>\n<p>There are five tags:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>source</strong>: name of the place the visitor came from</li>\n<li>\n<strong>medium</strong>: \"how\" the visitor arrived</li>\n<li>\n<strong>campaign</strong>: Describes the \"initiative\" that brought the visitor</li>\n<li>\n<strong>term</strong>: Any terms associated with the link, if applicable (e.g. Google Adwords)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>content</strong> Further descriptions of the link to help distinguish variations. <strong>We require that you to add --sku[your sku id] to this field for our tracking to work.</strong>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You can use whatever values you want but it's best to standardize the values you choose to make interpretation and analysis easy. We recommend the following:</p>\n<p><strong>Properties for source and medium:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360023642232/2.png\" alt=\"2.png\" width=\"876\" height=\"460\"></p>\n<p>Your sku ID can be found as the number in the URL itself or in your portal:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360023642792/bgNkzRur1z3JR_-rnU3_T6c9.png\" alt=\"bgNkzRur1z3JR_-rnU3_T6c9.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>Best practices:</strong> no spaces, no capitalization, and use dashes to separate words. These fields will be visible to the visitors so avoid terms that might cause insult.</p>\n<p>In our scenario, we want to post about our new game on Twitter, so we'll choose the following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>source: twitter</li>\n<li>medium: social</li>\n<li>campaign: launch</li>\n<li>term: n/a</li>\n<li>content: --sku488607666231443456</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We can use <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/campaign-url-builder/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Google's UTM Builder</a> to generate our completed link:<br><br></p>\n<p><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.discordapp.com/store/skus/488607666231443456/minion-masters?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=launch&amp;utm_content=--sku488607666231443456--test\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.discordapp.com/store/skus/488607666231443456/minion-masters?utm_source=<strong>twitter</strong>&amp;utm_medium=<strong>social</strong>&amp;utm_campaign=<strong>launch</strong>&amp;utm_content=<strong>--sku488607666231443456</strong></a></p>\n<p>That's all the setup needed! We're now ready to begin sharing this link.</p>\n<h3 id=\"step-3-share-the-link\">\n<strong>Step 3</strong>: Share the link</h3>\n<p>If we were hyperlinking something in a blog or on our homepage, people wouldn't see the full link. But since we're posting it on Twitter, people will see it. It's not very pretty.</p>\n<p>We can use any URL shortener to make this more easy to share. Be sure to shorten the <em>entire </em>link from Step 2, including the UTM parameters.</p>\n<p>In our example, we used a popular, free link-shortening service called <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://bitly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bitly</a> to create a shortened link: <a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"http://bit.ly/2tNKWLr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">http://bit.ly/2tNKWLr</a><br><br><br><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360023643512/2__1__.gif\" alt=\"2__1__.gif\"></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We can post this link on Twitter and drive traffic that Discord can now track for conversions!</p>\n<h3>\n<strong>Step 4</strong>: Tracking Conversion</h3>\n<p>Since we'll be able to see that visitors arrived from this link we'll be able to report back how many people \"converted.\"</p>\n<p>We define \"conversion\" as a visitor who acquired the game—the one associated with the sku ID you labeled in the utm_content field—within 24 hours of visiting. For games that have a price, this means a purchase took place and the game has been added to their library. For free-to-play games this only means the visitor added the game to their library.</p>\n<p>Results will be available in your developer portal. In our above example, you might expect to see something like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360023643992/2____.png\" alt=\"2____.png\"></p>\n<p><strong>A note on re-using links:</strong> We will show you results for each unique combination of tags that we find. Which means you can—and should—use the same link with the same set of tags multiple times if you want to see the results aggregated together. A good rule of thumb to figure out whether you should re-use UTM tags is: \"Do I want to see one row of results or many rows of results?\"</p>\n<p>Say your custom home page has a link to your Discord store page in each the header, the body, and the footer. If you want to see one row of data for just \"traffic from my homepage,\" then you can use the same link with the same tags in all three spots. You'll get back one row of data that sums results across any of the links. If the tags are the same, it looks like the same link to us.</p>\n<h3>More Example Use Cases</h3>\n<p id=\"permanent-link-on-your-custom-home-page\">Permanent link on your custom home page</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>source: minion-masters</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>medium: homepage</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>campaign: n/a</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>term: n/a</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>content: --sku488607666231443456</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"link-in-an-email-newsletter\">Link in an email newsletter</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>source: minion-masters</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>medium: email</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>campaign: my-newsletter</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>term: n/a</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>content: --sku488607666231443456</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"giving-a-link-to-a-streamer-influencer-to-promote-a-beta\">Giving a link to a streamer/influencer to promote a beta</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>source: twitch</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>medium: affiliate</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>campaign: beta-launch</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>term: n/a</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>content: --sku488607666231443456</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"google-ads-promoting-a-sale\">Google Ads promoting a sale</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>source: google</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>medium: cpc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>campaign: 2019-spring-sale</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>term: deck-building</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>content: --sku488607666231443456</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p id=\"facebook-paid-campaign\">Facebook Paid Campaign</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>source: facebook</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>medium: cpc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>campaign: 2019-spring-sale</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>term: gamers-deck-building (i.e. custom audiences)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>content: --sku488607666231443456</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"callout\">For a better understanding of the <strong>analytics definitions</strong> check out this guide <a href=\"https://support-dev.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024852152\" target=\"_self\">here</a>. </p>"

A SKU, or stock-keeping unit, is a tool used to keep track of inventory. In the context of Premium Apps, premium features can be thought of as \"products\" that your App offers. These “products” can be tracked through their own SKU and managed in the Developer Portal of your application.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HAWGE42AHRH5CNNZ5WQBSCDT\">Types of SKUs</h2>\n<p>At this time, there are two types of SKUs supported by Premium Apps</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8Y9KX1AG3WV48HC16SD8W4\">User Subs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows a user to purchase access to your app’s premium features across all servers they are in with the app</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8Y9KX1R275K4V1A5NG2CQJ\">Guild Subs</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Allows a server owner to purchase access to your app’s premium features that can be offered to all members on that server</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that you know what a SKU is and the different types of SKUs available, you can start managing your premium features in the Developer Portal. Your app can currently feature one published SKU, but there is no limit to the unpublished SKUs you can create for your app.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HAWGE42AV48E0ACGK0YG046K\">Adding SKUs</h2>\n<p class=\"callout\">⚠️ As described more in our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Monetization-Terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monetization Terms</a>, you must accurately and fully describe your premium offering. Furthermore, in compliance with the <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17442400631959\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Premium Apps Policy</a>, any names, descriptions, icons, and other text or imagery representing your premium SKU cannot contain any bad or harmful content.</p>\n<p>In the app’s developer portal page under the Monetization tab, Team Owners and Admins can add SKUs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/17717777198999\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-09-15 at 9.23.37 AM.png\"></p>\n<p>Several options can be customized for your app’s premium offering:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A name for your premium SKU, max 80 characters.</li>\n<li>A description for your premium SKU, max 160 characters</li>\n<li>An icon for your premium SKU</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You're also able to customize a list of benefits. These are displayed on the App Directory, and during the purchase and cancellation flows to explain to users the benefits of your premium offering. These benefits can have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Up to 6 benefits</li>\n<li>An emoji, standard or custom</li>\n<li>A name, max 80 characters</li>\n<li>A description, max 160 characters</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HAWGE42A0VGD9M2ZX5TBK0DB\">Integrating SKUs</h2>\n<p>Once SKUs have been added, you can begin to integrate them into your App via the API.

If you wish to change the SKU that is published, you can do so at any time by first unpublishing the currently published one. Keep in mind that when you unpublish a SKU, it is no longer available for sale, but <span class=\"discussion-id-904387d8-cccd-496c-b1a0-529121c2fb31 notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\">users</span> who have already subscribed will remain <span class=\"discussion-id-398d4b7e-1df8-44da-9c44-ce476396c4cb notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"3\">subscribed</span> and you must continue to make the premium offering available to them until the end of their subscription.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HAWGFTVPA4X1VMP4XCG7RFBZ\">Remove SKUs</h3>\n<p>When removing SKUs, keep in mind that this will unsubscribe everyone from it. If you are having any trouble removing SKUs, please <a href=\"https://dis.gd/developer-support/premium-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reach out to Developer Support</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HCZP2Q53FJ6NBVP6J4DZ85MR\">Analytics</h2>\n<p>In the Monetization section of the developer portal, you will also see an <strong>Analytics</strong> tab. When reviewing a Premium App’s analytics data, a couple of considerations should be made.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HCZP2Q53SYESTQPWQK9YWS7Y\">Availability</h3>\n<p>The available data can be considered up-to-date data as of 24 hours prior. Any representation of subscription data will reflect that of the previous day, based on system updates. This applies to user and revenue data, alike.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HCZP2Q537A342VRBQ5932DWS\">Accuracy</h3>\n<p>If after reviewing the analytics, it appears the data is inaccurate and the 24 hour period has been taken into account, keep in mind that only subscribers who have <code>Use data to improve Discord</code> enabled will be represented. Users that do not have this setting enabled will not reflect in a Premium App’s subscription analytics. However, this only applies to user data and does not apply to revenue data. Any representation of revenue data will be accurate based on the above mentioned availability period.</p>\n<p class=\"callout\">⚠️ If you are not seeing SKU data populate, please ensure you have selected a SKU from the dropdown, toward the top of the Analytics page. </p>\n<p>After reviewing this and other linked articles, if you have any questions about Premium Apps SKU setup, please <a href=\"https://dis.gd/developer-support/premium-apps\">reach out to our Developer Support team</a>!</p>"

If needed you can review the <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17297949965079\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">How Do I Monetize My App?</a> article and <a href=\"https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17298449675927\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">set up SKUs</a> for more information on how to get to this step in the process, or learn more about the payout process in our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Monetization-Terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monetization Terms</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8YZFMVJZZJH9ZJK9FPFX87\">Payout Eligibility Review</h3>\n<p>This payout does not happen automatically, however. A ticket will be created on behalf of the team owner, and a payout eligibility review will be conducted by Developer Support. If the app is approved for payout, Developer Support will enable payout and the team will then be able to receive payouts.</p>\n<p>Please note that if not all criteria are met and you have the ability to remedy this, you will be given guidance on what is left to complete in order to receive payouts.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HB8YZFMVC6DEWD4Z02MSSQY6\">Payout</h3>\n<p>All payouts are processed through Stripe and revenue history can be viewed from your dashboard there. This dashboard can be accessed via your Team’s <a href=\"https://discord.com/developers/teams\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Developer Portal page</a> under the Payout Settings tab.</p>\n<p>Eligible payouts will be provided within 45 days after the end of each calendar month. For example, for Offerings purchased in January, you will receive payouts within 45 days after January 31st. An eligible payout can be defined as the first $100 earned and for the following billing cycles, in amounts greater than $25. This means that if your balance is less than $25 on time of payout, the balance is carried over to the next billing cycle until an amount of $25 or greater can be paid.</p>\n<p>As described in our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Monetization-Terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monetization Terms</a>, for each purchase of a Premium App Subscription you offer, you will receive 70% of the total payments from the user less applicable payment processing fees and transaction fees, with the remaining 30% as a platform fee to Discord. We may also deduct chargebacks, refunds, and associated fees from your payout.</p>\n<p>The platform fee allows Discord to invest more money back into the developer community. This reinvestment can come in the form of improved tools, resources, and support for developers, as well as financial incentives such as grants or bonuses. By investing in the developer community, the platform can encourage further innovation and growth, ultimately benefiting both the platform and its users.</p>\n<p>If Developer Support determines you or your app is not complying with our applicable <a class=\"notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http://dis.gd/terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-token-index=\"1\">Terms of Service</a>, <a class=\"notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"http://dis.gd/guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-token-index=\"3\">Community Guidelines</a>, <a class=\"notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-terms-of-service\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-token-index=\"5\">Developer Terms</a>, and <a class=\"notion-link-token notion-focusable-token notion-enable-hover\" tabindex=\"0\" href=\"https://discord.com/developers/docs/policies-and-agreements/developer-policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-token-index=\"7\">Developer Policy</a>, your app will not be approved, and you will not be eligible, for payout.</p>\n<p>After reviewing this and other linked articles, if you have any questions about Premium Apps payouts, please <a href=\"https://dis.gd/developer-support/premium-apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">reach out to our Developer Support team</a>!</p>"
