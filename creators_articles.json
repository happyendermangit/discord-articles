Subscribers will be able to view or download content but subscribers wont have access unless they subscribe.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H1PGZDGKKX8YV9AVV9HYP5GW\">Bonus Content or File Downloads</h2>\n<p>To enhance your Server Subscriptions offering you can you can use Media Channels to post content or files for your paying subscribers. This could be for a dedicated Server Subscriptions tier or a way to add additional value to an existing tier. To do this just:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Create a Media Channel and assign a new role connected to a Server Subscription tier. The subscriber will only have access to the new Media channel if they are subscribed.</li>\n<li>Start posting content! This could be short behind-the-scenes videos, images, unlisted YouTube videos or even wallpapers, files, and / or PDFs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>BONUS:</strong> Don’t forget to share Media channel posts across your server to drive awareness and convert more people into paying subscribers.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H1PGZM21ZNYKG839ZD6RMTJ8\">Share Media Channel Posts</h2>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\"><img src=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14445981952279\" alt=\"share-media-posts-in-server.gif\"></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\">Media Channels give you a space to provide extra content and or files to subscribers, but in order to get more members of your community to convert into new subscribers you can share individual posts from your Media Channel to other public channels within your server. Non-subscribers will see the post but will not be able to view the content unless they subscribe. </span></p>\n<p><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\">This is what a Media Channel post will look like to <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" style=\"font-weight: 600;\" data-token-index=\"1\">non-subscribers</span> when shared to a public channel: </span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\"><img src=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14445881751319\" alt=\"media-preview-for-non-subs.png\"></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\">Subscribers will <span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" style=\"font-weight: 600;\" data-token-index=\"1\">see the media thumbnail revealed </span>when shared to a public channel.</span></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><span class=\"notion-enable-hover\" data-token-index=\"1\"><img src=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/14445881748503\" alt=\"media-preview-for-subs.png\"></span></p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01H1PGZXVC1MCKAB7T41Q3KGAJ\">FAQ</h1>\n<p><strong>Q: What types of content is supported?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Videos, photos, and files can be posted to Media channels. File upload size is limited to the existing channels can support today.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind, different video links and embeds behave differently depending on the website they are hosted at. Some video links (ie. YouTube) will embed natively and provide a more native viewing experience than others.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: This product is in Beta. What happens to my media channel if Discord decides to remove the product?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If we decide not to support this feature long-term your media channel will not go away.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why don’t I see the media channels as an option for my server?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A.</strong> Media channels is currently in beta testing and only available to a limited number of servers with Server Subscriptions enabled. We hope to roll this out more broadly in the coming months but cannot share any further details at this time.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What’s the difference between Media Channels and Forum Channels with gallery view?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Today, Media channels leverage many of the same foundational elements as Forum Channels in gallery view but with feedback from creators and community admins like you we hope to add unique features over time which make Media channels offer unique solutions for media first communities.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How can I be sure my exclusive content won’t be leaked by my subscribers?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Subscribers will be able to see your gated content and non-subscribers will see a blurred image if the post is shared with them.</p>\n<p>Over time our tools will improve but if you have feedback, suggestions, on how we can make this better for your community <a href=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/14512705617175-Server-Subscriptions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">feel free to share it with us</a>!</p>"

If you’re not a server owner, please speak with the server owner about taking the steps above.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1VAZKHGGZ7D4RXNMW\">How do payments work?</h2>\n<p><strong>How much money will I earn?</strong></p>\n<p>Discord has a <strong>90 / 10 split</strong>. This means you will receive 90% of the money that you earn from each monthly subscription and/or one-time purchase you sell, and Discord will keep 10%. Keep in mind, there are various fees that will impact your final payment amount.</p>\n<p><strong>When will I get paid?</strong></p>\n<p>Once you accept our Monetization Terms, your server will be reviewed at the end of each month to determine if you’re eligible to receive a payout. To receive your <strong>first payout</strong>, your server must have earned at least $100 and meet our <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Monetization-Terms\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monetization Terms</a> and <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10575066024983-Discord-Server-Subscription-Policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Monetization Policy</a>. If your server has earned less than $100 on its first monthly review date, it will be reviewed again at the end of the next month—and we’ll continue this process until you’ve earned $100.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve earned your first payout, you’ll need to earn $25 to be eligible for <strong>subsequent payouts</strong>.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you start monetizing your server on January 1 and earn $100 by January 30, your server would be reviewed on January 31, and you’d most likely receive your $100 payout in February. If you went on to earn at least $25 by February 28, you’d most likely receive that payout in March.</li>\n<li>If you start monetizing your server on January 15 but don’t earn $100 until February 5, your server would be reviewed on February 28, and you’d most likely receive your $100 payout (plus any additional earnings from February) in March.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How will I receive payments?</strong></p>\n<p>To be eligible to receive payouts, you’ll need to create an account with a third-party payout provider made available to you on Discord.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve accepted our Monetization Terms, you’ll be prompted to create an account, and you won’t be eligible to receive a payout until our provider has provisioned your account.</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please see our<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/articles/5330075836311\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> Monetization Terms</a> for more information on payout eligibility, timelines, and process.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1331MJBNBPR30KSVK\"><strong>SERVER SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong></h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1KP5DX848N5K60E1J\"><strong>WHAT ARE SERVER SUBSCRIPTIONS?</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Server Subscription</strong>s give you the ability to create subscription tiers for paying members, offering them premium experiences with unlockable servers and channels.</p>\n<p>If you’re not a server admin but have questions related to your subscription to a server, you can<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415163187607\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> visit this help page for more information.</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR18WXN305RK8Y870JZ\"><strong>HOW DO I CREATE SERVER SUBSCRIPTIONS?</strong></h2>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR163JP0QS8CMJR4NF9\" class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19792341134871\" width=\"624\" height=\"595\"></h2>\n<p>1.

Right-click on your server and select <strong>Server Subscriptions</strong> from the menu</p>\n<p>2. Head to the <strong>Payment</strong> section where you’ll see a <strong>Disable Server Subscriptions</strong> button in red.</p>\n<p>3.

This will only enable free trials for the tier you are editing. </p>\n<p>Remember that you are responsible for ensuring your offering and any promotions are promoted in compliance with applicable laws, including applicable advertising laws. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1JT5KKVZMZEFRJG3A\"><strong>HOW DO I SET THE DURATION OF THE FREE TRIAL? </strong></h2>\n<p>By default, Free Trials are set to (1) week, but you may also set the duration for (1) day. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR19C5E14G5J1KJPA5N\"><strong>CAN I GIFT A FREE MONTH OF MY SERVER SUBSCRIPTION TO SOMEONE?</strong></h2>\n<p>This is not possible with Free Trials, but you can manually give one or more people access to the channels associated with a Server Subscription tier through Channel Settings.</p>\n<p>Remember that you need to manually remove channel access from them if you change your mind. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1KGKG0W03120HB68Z\"><strong>CAN I LIMIT THE QUANTITY OF FREE TRIALS?</strong></h2>\n<p>Yes! You can limit the number of Free Trials each tier has available at a given time from 10, 25, 50, 100, or unlimited (default). Once the number of Free Trials has been reached, there will no longer be any Free Trials available. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1ZNEGWV5J56VM8JBJ\"><strong>ONCE THE FREE TRIAL IS OVER, WILL THEY BE IMMEDIATELY CHARGED? </strong></h2>\n<p>Yes. They can cancel before a Trial ends. At the end of a Trial, if they have not canceled, they will begin paying for recurring monthly subscriptions, charged to their default payment method on file. They must enter a payment method to start a Free Trial if they do not have a payment on file with Discord. They can cancel paid subscriptions at any point to stop auto-renewals the following month.</p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR11S7QFE0HK12FY97Q\"><strong>PREMIUM EMOJI FOR SERVER SUBSCRIPTIONS</strong></h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1XQTFPMYQMVHZTDMF\"><strong>What are Premium Emoji?</strong></h2>\n<p>Adding exclusive Emoji is a great way to add value to your Server Subscription tiers.

Then, you will be able to fill out the details and price for your product, select whether you want to include a Role and/or a Downloadable, and upload your Downloadable (if applicable). </p>\n<p>3. After you have finished, press <strong>Publish </strong>to upload it to your list of server products as a<br><strong>Downloadable </strong>or<strong> Premium Role. </strong></p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><strong><img src=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19792341179031\" width=\"529\" height=\"393\"></strong> </p>\n<p>4. Then, navigate to the desired product and select <strong>Publish</strong> once more. Once you hit <strong>Publish</strong>, <strong>Server Shop</strong> will appear at the top of your channel list and be visible to your members. Pressing Server Shop will allow your server members to view the Downloadable or Premium Role and make a one-time purchase.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1MBYGJ20PACDM6XE6\">How do I customize my Server Shop?</h2>\n<p>Navigate to the <strong>Server Products </strong>tab within Server Settings and select <strong>Basic Info</strong>. From here, you can add a description and cover image.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR19GSSZ25P2HBGEY1C\">How do members purchase Server Products?</h2>\n<p>Members can click Server Shop in your channel list to purchase Server Products directly. You can also copy the product link and paste it into any text channel within your server, allowing members to purchase it through the product embed. Head’s up that the product embed will not show up if you share the product link outside of your server.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1RNSBHVZ71DAXXHQ7\">How do I delete a Server Product? </h2>\n<p>Before you delete a Downloadable or Premium Role from your Server Shop, you will need to unpublish it on desktop or through browser. Server Products can only be managed on a desktop computer.</p>\n<p>1. To remove the product, head to <strong>Server Products</strong> within your <strong>Server Settings</strong>. </p>\n<p>2. Once in Server Products, select the vertical ellipsis within the desired product. This will trigger a menu where you can select <strong>Unpublish Product</strong>. </p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19792341187991\" width=\"510\" height=\"464\"></p>\n<p>3. Afterwards, the product will show as<strong> In Progress</strong> and no longer be visible to members in the Server Shop. </p>\n<p>4. Now that the product is unpublished, select the vertical ellipsis and press <strong>Delete Product</strong>. You will be asked to reconfirm once more that you would like to delete the product, and that should do it!</p>\n<p class=\"wysiwyg-text-align-center\"><img src=\"https://creator-support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/19792371318167\" width=\"597\" height=\"281\"></p>\n<p>Once a product has been deleted, this action cannot be undone and you will not be able to recover the product. </p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1RPMGV696TTFPB9XA\">How can a customer request a refund of a Server Product?</h2>\n<p>We are unable to provide refunds for server products, so please be sure that your product descriptions are honest and accurate to ensure that your customers are satisfied. If you’d like to learn more about our refund policy, you can do so <a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012668071-Refund-Policy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n<h1 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR1Z3F3Q1JJ9N7NVRD6\"><strong>OTHER FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</strong></h1>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR13CA03PD67K3JQWMP\"><strong>ROLES, PERMISSIONS, &amp; ADMINS</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Q: Is it possible to hide Server Subscription channels from regular members? For example, if I don't want premium inaccessible channels \"clogging\" up the overall channel list view for those who are not subscribers?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No, you can’t hide inaccessible channels at this time. You can order your channels so that premium channels are lower than the free channels. Another option is to create a channel and add the tier role via channel settings (can view, chat etc.), NOT via Server Subscriptions settings. This is similar to how people have hidden channels on their server today.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When creating a Server Subscriptions gated channel, is there a way to give access to certain roles (like moderators + admins) that haven't paid for the premium channels?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, you can just create a premium channel and add normal roles as you want. You can add the \"admin\" or “moderator” role to your premium channels through channel settings. This will allow your admin(s) and moderator(s) to access the premium channels for moderation etc, without needing to purchase a Server Subscription .</p>\n<p><strong>Q: We have legacy members that we want to grant access to Server Subscriptions , can I give my legacy VIPs access to premium channels via permissions, without them having to pay?</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes -- you can grant access to Server  Subscriptions  by adding each individual user into the channels via permissions on the backend.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: If a Premium member leaves the server (voluntarily or kicked/banned) and then comes back, would they automatically be given their premium perks/role back?</strong></p>\n<p>A: If a premium member leaves for any reason (voluntarily, kicked, banned), their Server Subscription is canceled, meaning they won't auto-renew the next month. If a membership holder leaves voluntarily, and then rejoins, they will retain the membership perks and  roles through the remainder of their paid month.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can admins manage the subscription tiers and see payment details, or is that only possible by the server owner? </strong></p>\n<p>A: Admins can change subscription tier details, but the server owner is the only person who can change and see payment information like payout account details and the payments tab. </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Can individuals temporarily be removed from a premium channel while still staying subscribed? (ie. disciplinary action for breaking the rules etc without performing a full kick or ban.)</strong></p>\n<p>A: Yes, you (or your moderators) can time people out without fully removing their subscription benefits. For instructions on time outs, see<a href=\"https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413305239191\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"> here</a>.</p>\n<p>You would need to give them a role with permissions that denies them the ability to chat, but this is a manual process for each channel, for a specific user, which you'd then have to manually remove later.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HHG1XZR23FKGH8Y1VE5QGMAB\"><strong>Mobile Support</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Q: When will Server Subscriptions be supported on the Discord mobile app? </strong></p>\n<p>A: We are currently rolling out In-App Purchasing (IAP) for iOS mobile devices to servers with Server Subscriptions enabled.  </p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do mobile subscriptions have the same revenue split as desktop subscriptions?</strong></p>\n<p>A: No. Apple takes an additional 30% of revenue from all subscriptions initiated through the Discord iOS application. Subscribers on iOS mobile devices will see a higher price on iOS checkout to account for the additional iOS fee. </p>\n<p>More information on the fee structures is available in the Monetization Terms: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/5330075836311-Monetization-Terms</p>\n<p><strong>Q: When will subscriptions be purchasable on Android?</strong></p>\n<p>A: We’re working on it! We don’t have any timing to share at this point but we are actively working to bring Server Subscriptions to Android mobile devices.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Why am I unable to see Server Products when using the mobile app? </strong></p>\n<p>A: Server Products is currently a limited experiment that’s only available on desktop and web within the United States. If you are still unable to see this feature while on desktop and web, please be sure to join our waitlist <a href=\"https://share.hsforms.com/1lyeXVPncR_CYxaE-61u6yw2bach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n<p id=\"docs-internal-guid-4bf1aa3b-7fff-17f0-2da8-fb24160557e4\"><strong>Q: Do my server members get a grace period for Server Subscription payments?<br></strong>A: Your members with a Server Subscription through the iOS App Store will have a grace period of 28 days to correct the payment issue if their auto-renewal payment fails. If the payment issue is fixed within that 28 day period, the subscription will continue. However, if a successful payment is not made within the 28 days, the subscription and features associated with it will end.</p>\n<p> </p>"
